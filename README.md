Google Scholar Analytics Project
=======

Accounts or profiles on Google Scholar contained articles that did not belonged to the owner of the profile. Research tactics were devised and data was gathered to prove the issue and highlight it.
The project was completed as a research and final year project at LUMS. 

Please refer to Report.pdf for details of the project.

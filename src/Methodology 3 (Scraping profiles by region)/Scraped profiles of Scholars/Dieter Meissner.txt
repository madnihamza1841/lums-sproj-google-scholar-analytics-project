Publication: The authors investigated if it is possible in principle to use wood gas from a fluidised bed steam gasification unit as fuel for microtube SOFC (solid oxide fuel cells). The applicability of the main components of the gas as well as the influence of hydrochloride were analysed. In the latter case, the cells were operated with different concentrations of these impurities in pure hydrogen, and their electric performance was recorded. Further, the influence of different volume flows and intermittent operation with impure and pure hydrogen was investigated, and temperature cycle tests were carried out between 573 K and 1173 K. Operating temperatures of the tests were 1123 K and 1173 K.(orig.)

Publication: Wels University, Austria, in cooperation with alp {sup 2} s fuel cell systems, have been working on the development of microtube solid oxide fuel cells for some time. With 3D CT technology, important results were achieved within a very short time. For example, problems concerning local layer densities of the electrolyte carrier tube and electrodes could be detected. Further, porosities in the electrolyte layer could be detected which affect mechanical strength and ion conductivity. CT was particularly important for investigating electric discharge of the electrodes. The very first measurements already showed that the electrical contact with the anode inside the cell is particularly critical, and that the metal cages now used in the cells will result in insufficient electrical contact.[German] Die Fachhochschule Wels beschaeftigt sich seit geraumer Zeit in Zusammenarbeit mit der Firma alp {sup 2} s fuel cell systems mit der Entwicklung von mikrotubulaeren Festoxidbrennstoffzellen. Durch den Einsatz der dreidimensionalen Computertomographie konnten hier schon nach kurzer Zeit entscheidende Ergebnisse bezueglich des Aufbaus der anfangs verwendeten Zellen erlangt werden. So konnten unter anderem Probleme bei den lokalen Schichtdicken des Elektrolyttraegerroehrchens und auch bei den Elektroden detektiert werden. Weiters konnten aufgrund dieser Messungen Porositaeten in der Elektrolytschicht detektiert werden, welche neben verminderten mechanischen Festigkeiten

Publication: The photophysical properties of a new dyad molecule composed of a covalently linked Zn-phthalocyanine antennadonor and a C60 derivative acceptor have been investigated. We report experimental evidence of long-lived charge separation in the solid state with a lifetime several orders of magnitude higher than in solution. Such a long lifetime, unusual for phthalocyaninefullerene dyads, is the basis for possible photovoltaic applications. A first demonstration of a working solar cell using phthalocyaninefullerene dyads as the active material is presented. Though the power conversion efficiency under simulated solar illumination of 80 mW cm2 is found to be moderate 0.02, it is an encouraging result for application of C60 dyad molecules to photovoltaics.

Publication: In collaboration between a chemical institute of Bremen University and the Institute of Solar Energy Research in Hannover fundamental work for the use of molecular organic semiconductors in Schottky-, double-and triple-photovoltaic cells was carried out. As n-conductors perylene tetracarboxylic acid diimides and as p-conductors phthalocyanine were employed. Films obtained by vapour deposition exhibit high light absorption in a wide visible range, in thin layers high quantum yields of the photo-current (up to 80%) and high open circuit voltages. The efficiencies of {<=} 0.5% are limited by thin active regions ({approx} 20 nm) and recombinations resulting in too low photocurrents and, in addition, inhomogenities resulting in too low fill factors. Photovoltaic cells could be prepared reproducible. The working of the cells were shown by function of different clocks.(orig.)[Deutsch] In Zusammenarbeit zwischen einem chemischen Institut der Universitaet Bremen und dem Solarforschungsinstitut in Hannover wurden grundlegende Arbeiten zur Verwendung molekularer organischer Halbleiter in Schottky-, Doppelschicht-und Dreischicht-Photovoltazellen durchgefuehrt.

Die durch Aufdampfen hergestellten Filme zeigen hohe Lichtabsorption ueber weite Bereiche des sichtbaren Spektrums, in duennen Schichten hohe Quantenausbeuten des Photostroms (bis 80%) und gute Leerlaufspannungen.

Publication: Progress in the development of solar cells is closely linked to the improvement of efficiency rates and the reduction of manufacturing costs. To this purpose, anorganic materials (silicon) are to be substituted by organic semiconductors (eg porphyrilins related to chlorophyll among other compounds). These compounds are viewed as promising materials for the'active'agent in thin film solar cells, effectively forming charge carriers when subjected to irradiation with visible light and separating them at a Schottky or p/n interface and removing them. The following organic semiconductors were presented in the initial phase of the project. p-conductors: phthalocyanine 1 (Pc) with M= 2H, Cu, Zn, V (0), Ga (F); Naphthalocyanine 2 (Nc) with M= 2H, Zn V (0). n-conductors: perylene tetracarboxylic acid diimide 3, 4.(orig./ORU).

Publication_date: Photoelectrochemical solar cells can be made on the basis of majority-and minority carrier devices. Since the forward dark current limits the photovoltage, the kinetics of the charge tansfer across the interface has been studied in detail. It is shown that the exchange current and consequently the forward current can be kineücally-or diffusion controlled, depending on the charge transfer rate at the interface. In the case of a majority carrier device, the forward currentis usually much smaller than that predicted from the thermionic emission model, leading to higher photovoltages in a photoelectrochemical cell. It is further shown that the forward current of a minority carrier device is mainly governed by the injection and recombination of minority carriers. Here the conversion efficiency is limited by the quality of the semiconductor, similarly as in pure solid state devices.

240. The Origin of Limited Photocurrent Efficiencies of Molecular Organic Solar Cells
Citations: 
Authors:Jörn Rostalski, Dieter Meissner
Publication_date: Molecular organic thin films find a widespread application in xerography [1]. Here the photoconductivity based on the production of majority carriers upon illumination is the key process. However, when using organic materials for the production of organic solar cells [2-4] majority as well as minority carriers need to be transported in the active charge generation layer. Therefore besides the charge separation mainly the mobility of minority carriers will determine the width of the active zone.
In our investigations short circuit photocurrent spectroscopy (Isc) has proven to be the best tool to determine the width and effectiveness of the charge generation layer formed in p/n-type junctions. However, the understanding of the spectra obtained critically depends on the exact determination of light absorption profiles. The absorption profiles have been calculated using the optical constants of the dye layers determined within a …

In Fig. 1 the topography (obtained by atomic force microscopy) of two films spin cast from either chlorobenzene or toluene solution is depicted. Clearly, a much larger feature size as well as film roughness is found for the samples cast from toluene, indicating a coarse phase separation.

Publication_date: Plastic Solar Cells [1] provide the possibility of easy and cheap production of large area photovoltaic devices on low cost polymer substrates. Based on interconnected networks of ptype polymers with percolating electron conducting Cöo derivatives, our group recently achieved more than 2.5% solar efficiency in devices of less than 100 nm thickness of the absorber layer, in which only a small portion of the solar light is absorbed [2].
The key for improving organic solar celi efficiencies was the fabrication of an interconnected network structure of p-and n-type materials to form a so-called bulk hetero junction. In such devices the flat interface of classical organic solar cells [3] is replaced by an extremely rough network such as also used in modern sensitization solar cells [4]. Photo induced electron transfer has been demonstrated in composites of conjugated polymer/CdS and CdSe nanocrystals and conjugated polymer …

The analysis of frequency spectra for the real and imaginary parts of the complex impedance was performed on the basis of proposed equivalent circuits for the PEC operating in the dark and under illumination. Additionally, CZTS membrane surface modifications (different chemical, thermal or mechanical treatments) to modify the photoelectrical properties in PEC are investigated. Here the deposition of Effective Barrier metal catalysts play an crucial role for intended water splitting and CO2-reduction.[3]

247. Morphology of Thin Film Organic Semiconductors for Solar Cell Applications
Citations: 
Authors:Renate Hiesgen, Dieter Meissner
Publication_date: Organic dyes like phthalocyanines (Pcs) and perylene pigments (PPs) are promising materials for the use in thin film devices. Besides their semiconducting electronic properties with n-and p-type character, respectively, they are stable enough to be thermally evaporated. This also makes them attractive candidates for the production of photovoltaic cells. Since their absorption coefficient is in the order of 10 6 a film thickness of less than 100 nm is sufficient to absorb all the light. However, previous investigations have shown that the active layer has a width of only about 10 nm to 20 nm [1, 2]. Therefore, thicker organic layers do not increase the photocurrent but increase the series resistance only. This requires special precautions when preparing films, the use of extremely smooth substrates and a nearly perfect film growths. Eg ITO, as the typical transparent conductive window material, with its average grain size in the …

248. Amorphous Carbon (aC: H): a Mono-Elemental CerMet
Citations: 
Authors:Boris Rubarth, Dieter Meissner
Publication_date: Amorphous carbon films, deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (plasma-CVD) or sputtering are very often treated analogous to amorphous silicon (a-Si: H), a semiconductor meanwhile very commonly used for electronic (display) or photovoltaic applications. However, due to the vast range of properties the materials are sometimes called plasma polymers of diamond like carbon.
In our investigations we were focussing on the electrical and optical properties of these materials. Just by changing the input power leading to self-bias voltages of between 100 and 1000 V, we were able to change the conductivity of such deposited films by 10 orders of magnitude (between 10-12 and 10-2 S cm-1)[1]. However, as already reported in this conference [2], at the same time the optical (as well as the mechanical) properties change. Whereas the films deposited at 100 V are transparent (and" soft"), their color changes steadily to a very deep black for the highly conductive and extremely hard as well as chemically resistant films.

249. Direct Investigation of the Electrochemical Double Layer
Citations: 
Authors:Renate Hiesgen, Dieter Meissner
Publication_date: With the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) not only the investigation of structural properties of surfaces down to atomic scale became possible. Also new techniques were developed to study a variety of physical, eg electronic, properties. Using semiconductor samples one approach is to investigate the local electronic properties by using the magnitude of the photocurrent at a semiconductor surface. Here, a resolution of 1 nm in the photocurrent image can be achieved [1]. The photocurrent is generated at the semiconductor surface where a large band bending is caused by the water layer present at the semiconductor surface in ambient air. The photogenerated charge carriers can be measured as a tunneling current through the STM tip. Since the local magnitude of the photocurrent is influenced by the position of the band edges at the surface, local space charge regions connected with surface structures like steps can be detected [2]. With this method it has also been possible to directly image the particle size dependent width of the space charge regions connected to nanosized metal particles on a semiconductor surface [3] which is of interest eg for the catalytic influence of nanosized metal particles (multiple nano contacts: MNCs) on the electron transfer in electrochemistry or photoelectrochemistry [4]. In ambient air the contact formed by the STM tip, the tunneling gap, and the semiconductor surface behaves like a MIS-(metal-insulator-semiconductor) contact [5]. The most important property of this contact is that the short circuit photocurrent is in a certain range independent of the distance between the tunneling tip and the …

250. Efficient Bulk Heterojunction Solar Cells from Conjugated Polymer/Fullerene Blends
Citations: 
Authors:Christoph J Brabec, Sean E Shaheen, Minze T Rispens, Jan C Hummelen, Rene AJ Janssen, Dieter Meissner, N Serdar Sariciftci
Publication_date: Bulk heterojunction solar cells from conjugated polymer/fullerene blends follow in many ways the concepts for inorganic solar cells. Generally, the operation of a photovoltaic device may be visualized as taking place in three consecutive fundamental steps:(1) absorption of light,(2) creation of separate charges at the donor—acceptor interfaces, and (3) selective transport of the charges through the bulk of the device to the appropriate collecting electrodes. A prerequisite for high efficiency for the conversion of photons into electrical current is that the holes and electrons do not recombine before being swept out of the device to the external circuit. Therefore, a metastable photoinduced charge-separated state and high charge carrier mobilities are important factors. A conjugated polymer—methanofullerene blend can provide both of these characteristics [1]. Time-resolved measurements [2] have shown that the initial photoinduced electron transfer from a conjugated polymer to a soluble methanofullerene occurs on the timescale of 50 fs, whereas the timescale for back transfer to the neutral state is very long and extends into the milliseconds range. Once this metastable charge-separated state is formed, the free charges are transported through the device through diffusion and drift processes. The latter is induced by using top and bottom layer electrodes that have different work-functions, thus providing a built-in electric field over the active layer. In the active layer of the device, holes are transported through the conjugated polymer matrix, and electrons are transported by hopping between fullerene molecules. Importantly, these two different charge …

251. Recent News from Organic Solar Cells
Citations: 
Authors:Jörn Rostalski, Dieter Meissner
Publication_date: A report on organic solar cells [1] was given by us in our annual workshops only once in 1993 [2]. Continuing research led to a considerable increase in understanding this type of solar cell. So we will report here on our latest results obtained on measurements and modelling of the optical and photoelectrical behavior of p/n-type structures made from zinc phthalocyanine and N, N,-dimethyle perylene tetracarboxylic diamide. Although the theory of electronical and optoelectronic phenomena is well understood in the case of organic crystals [3, 4] there is a lack of unique theories concerning organic thin film systems. A transfer of the theories developed for inorganic semiconductor thin films is seldom possible and useful.
In our investigations photocurrent spectroscopy has proven to be the best tool to determine the width and effectiveness of the charge generation layer formed at Schottky or p/n-type junctions [5, 6 …

252. Circuit Simulations to Understand Monograin Membrane Solar Cells
Citations: 
Authors:M Sams, C Lackner, D Meissner
Publication_date: Monograin Membrane Solar Cells as developed by crystalsol and the Tallinn Univ. of Technology consist of a large number of micro-solar cells connected in parallel. As complex electrical circuits their behavior can be modeled using a combination of a physics-based electrical equivalent circuit and an abstract mathematical model using fit parameters allowing to emulate eg current/voltage curves and their dependence of physical boundary conditions such as light intensity, temperature etc. In this first paper on results based on CZTS monograin membrane solar cell measurements the general approach and first results will be discussed.

253. Size dependent electrical fields of nanosized metal particles on WSe 2
Citations: 
Authors:Renate Hiesgen, Dieter Meissner
Publication_date: Using our STM we have developed a method to analyze the spatially resolved electric properties of a semiconductor sample using the photocurrent as a sensitive tool. With the experimental setup we are able to measure the local photocurrent together with the topography on semiconductor samples with a resolution less than 1 nm. The method used here is especially able to measure the short circuit photocurrent in order to distinguish it from pure photoconductivity but can also record the photocurrent under applied bias. Most measurements have been taken in air, but the method is also working in an electrochemical cell under potentiostatic control. WSe 2 is used as a model semiconductor. This is a layered compound with a nonreactive van der Waals surface providing large atomically flat terraces after cleaving. Crystals of a n-and p-type doping level of 4 x10 16 are used.

Authors:J DRECHSEL, P SIMON, F LI, S GRUNDMANN, S SONNTAG, M PFEIFFER, H HOPPE, D MEISSNER, NS SARICIFTCI, I RIEDEL, J PARISI
Publication_date: We introduce a p-i-n-type heterojunction architecture for organic solar cells where the active region is sandwiched between two doped wide-gap layers. The term p-i-n means here a layer sequence in the form p-doped layer, intrinsic layer and n-doped layer. The doping is realized by controlled co-evaporation using organic dopants and leads to conductivities of 10− 4 to 10− 5 S/cm in the p-and n-doped wide-gap layers, respectively. The photoactive layer is formed by a mixture of phthalocyanine zinc (ZnPc) and the fullerene C60 and shows mainly amorphous morphology. As a first step towards p-i-n structures, we show the advantage of using wide-gap layers in Mi-p-type diodes (metal layer–intrinsic layer–p-doped layer). The solar cells exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency of 40% between 630-nm and 700-nm wavelength. With the help of an optical multilayer model, we optimize the optical properties of the solar cells by placing the active region at the maximum of the optical field distribution. The results of the model are largely confirmed by the experimental findings. For an optically optimized device, we find an internal quantum efficiency of around 82% under shortcircuit conditions. Adding a layer of 10-nm thickness of the red material N, N-dimethylperylene-3, 4: 9, 10-dicarboximide (Me-PTCDI) to the active region, a power-conversion efficiency of 1. 9% for a single cell is obtained. Such optically thin cells with high internal quantum efficiency are an important step towards high-efficiency tandem cells. First tandem cells which are not yet optimized already show 2. 4% powerconversion efficiency under simulated AM 1.5 illumination of …

256. Nanocrystalline Diamond Films Prepared by Thermal Transformation of Electrochemically Deposited Diamond-Like Carbon Precursor

Authors:Anatoly I Kulak, Dieter Meissner, Tamara I Kulak, Detlef-M Smilgies
Publication_date: In the last two decades diamond films have found a wide application in different fields of science and technology due to the unique combination of their mechanical, chemical, electrochemical, electrical, optical and other properties. A growing interest in diamond coatings stimulates numerous investigations directed to the development of the novel methods for their production since the methods now in service (numerous chemical vapor deposition techniques, pulsed laser deposition, magnetron and ion-beam sputtering, cathodic arc, etc.)[1] remain rather complicated and expensive because of a great consumption of energy and the necessity for using very sophisticated equipment.
Here we show the possibility for obtaining diamond films by the electrochemical anodic deposition from dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution of lithium acetylide (LiC≡ CH) followed by the thermal treatment at 600 o C. The deposition of high …

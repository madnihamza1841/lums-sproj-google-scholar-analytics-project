Citations: 685
Authors:Douglas G Altman
Publication_date: 1986/2/8
Publication: In clinical measurement comparison of a new measurement technique with an established one is often needed to see whether they agree sufficiently for the new to replace the old. Such investigations are often analysed inappropriately, notably by using correlation coefficients. The use of correlation is misleading. An alternative approach, based on graphical techniques and simple calculations, is described, together with the relation between this analysis and the assessment of repeatability.(Lancet, 1986; i: 307-310)

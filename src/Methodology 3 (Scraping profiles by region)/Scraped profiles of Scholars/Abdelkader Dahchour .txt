Authors:Saïd Boujraf, Siham Tizniti, Abdelkader Dahchour, Mustapha Harandou, Robert Luypaert, Michel Osteaux
Publication_date: A color mapping of fiber tract orientation using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be prominent in clinical practice. The purpose of the work is to perform a comparative study of the visualisation of diffusion anisotropy in human brain using three different color-mapping techniques based on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and DTI. The first technique is based on calculating a color map from diffusion weighted images measured in three perpendicular directions. The second technique is based on the three eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor. The last technique is based on the three eigenvectors corresponding to the sorted eigenvalues. All the MR measurements were performed using a 1.5 Tesla Siemens Vision whole body imager. A single shot DW echo planar sequence imaging (EPI) used a Stejskal-Tanner approach. Trapezoidal diffusion gradients are used. The slice orientation was transverse. The basic …

29. Pomological characterization of Carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua L.) from the Province of Sefrou, Middle Atlas of Morocco

Authors:N Seghir, E Harki, A Dahchour, N Gharnit, A Ennabili
Publication_date: Forty five Sefrou carob populations from three sites were studied to assess their genetic variation based on pod and seed measures. Locust beans were characterised by: length, width, thickness, chord, weight, number and weight of seeds, aborted seeds rate and seeds yield in addition to the twist coefficient. For seeds, we measured the length, width, the ratio" width/length", the thickness, the ratio" width/thickness", the weight and the yields of the various parts of the seed ie, the endosperm, the embryo-cotyledons and the tegument. The results showed that the chord, the weight and the yields of seeds and pulp of the carob pod, and the seed weight allow a better discrimination between the three surveyed locations. However, there were no differences between the three localities regarding the width and thickness of the carob pod, and the seed tegument yield. Generally, the intra-locations changes show a very highly significant difference between the trees of each location for all the parameters studied. These results show that environmental conditions do not explain alone the variation in pomological parameters followed and thereby there would be probably a genotypic variability within each locality.

30. ESBRA NORDMANN AWARD LECTURE

Authors:Abdelkader Dahchour
Publication_date: There is increasing evidence that ethanol induces alterations in the central nervous system by differentially interfering with a number of neurotransmitter systems. However, the mechanisms by which ethanol produces many of its effects on the central nervous system are not well understood. The rationale of this work was intended to assess changes in excitatory and inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters. These changes were assayed within specific brain regions ie nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and frontal cortex of freely moving Wistar rats, after ethanol treatment using the in vivo microdialysis technique associated with electrochemical detection. The earliest studies have evidently demonstrated that sulphonated amino acid taurine content of nucleus accumbens (1), hippocampus (unpublished data), frontal cortex (unpublished data), and amygdala (3) microdialysate significantly increased 20-40 minutes after an acute injection of 1, 2, and 3 g/kg ethanol to naive rats. Likewise, in rats, which received chronic ethanol injections of 1, 2, and 3 g/kg body weight for 1, 2 and 3 weeks duration prior to the acute ethanol injections, a comparable increase in nucleus accumbens taurine microdialysate content was assayed (2). No significant changes were observed in either glutamate or GABA microdialysate contents in any of these studies. In rats, which were physically dependent upon alcohol (the ethanol dependence was induced by vapour inhalation for 4 weeks), the basal concentrations of both arginine and GABA were significantly decreased (5). However, during the first 12h-withdrawal phase only glutamate significantly increased, commencing …

31. Chronic effect of acamprosate on amino acids during the third ethanol withdrawal period
Citations: 
Authors:Abdelkader Dahchour, Philippe De Witte
Publication_date: The effects of chronic acamprosate (400 mg/kg/day; PO) under chronic ethanol treatment on amino acids in the hippocampus of Wistar male rats were examined during the third ethanol withdrawal period. In this study, rats were made ethanol dependent by four-week vapour inhalation. After this first cycle of chronic ethanol treatment (CET), rats underwent repeated and alternate cycles of 24h withdrawals and one week of CET. The microdialysis experiment was performed during the third ethanol withdrawal, together with the HPLC and electrochemical detection to quantify different amino acids such as aspartate, glutamate, taurine and alanine. During the first 4h of ethanol withdrawal, there were no significant changes in glutamate levels between acamprosate and nonacamprosate treated groups. During 4h and 8h 30 min glutamate levels were significantly decreased in non-acamprosate treated group by comparison to acamprosate treated group. After 10h from ethanol withdrawal glutamate levels were significantly increased in acamprosate non-treated group by comparison to acamprosate treated group. No changes were observed in other amino acids levels such as aspartate, taurine and alanine. The results of this work suggest that by acting on glutamate receptors chronic acamprosate could prevent neuroadaptation in glutamatergic system and thereby acamprosate may provide a protective mechanism against the neurotoxicity by reducing excitatory amino acids overexpression during repeated ethanol withdrawal.

Publication_date: 2014
Publication: Pure orthorhombic-phase WO₃·H₂O nanoparticles with sizes of about 5 nm were synthesized by pulsed plasma in deionized water, in which tungsten electrodes provide the source of tungsten and the water is the source of oxygen and hydrogen. The quenching effect and liquid environment inherent in this pulsed plasma in liquid method resulted in ultra-small particles with lattice lengths (a = 5.2516 Å, b = 10.4345 Å, c = 5.1380 Å) larger than those of reference lattices. The emission lines of W I atoms, W II ions and H I atoms were observed by an optical emission spectrum in order to gather information on the synthetic mechanism. These nanoparticles showed higher absorption in the visible region than did ST-01 TiO₂ and Wako WO₃ nanoparticles. The WO₃·H₂O nanoparticles displayed more activity in the photocatalytic test than did the commercial TiO₂ sample (ST-01). Also, the absorption edge of WO₃·H₂O shifted to longer wavelengths in the UV-Vis absorption pattern relative to that of the anhydrous tungsten oxide.

Publication_date: 2013/2/1
Publication: CoC {sub x} nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon shells were synthesized using a pulsed plasma in liquid ethanol. This is the first time that monolithic cubic phase cobalt carbide nanoparticles have been obtained. X-ray diffraction refinement of the nanoparticles showed that the lattice parameter of prepared cubic phase cobalt carbide is larger than that of CoC {sub x}(44-0962) and cubic phase Co (15-0806 and 01-1259). The x-ray absorption fine structure spectra near the Co K-edge of the synthesized sample indicated differences from commercial metallic cobalt and cobalt oxide samples. High resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed that a thin carbon coating covered the surface of the nanoparticles. These carbon layers might isolate core CoC {sub x} material from the outside environment, and allow functionalization by carboxyl groups for the further purpose of targeted drug delivery. The obtained CoC {sub x}-C particles, with a crystallite size of about 10 nm confirmed by the electron microscope, aggregate into 20-40 nm secondary particles in distilled water as shown by dynamic light scattering, and possess high saturation magnetization of about 120 emu g {sup-1}. The sodium 3 Prime-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3, 4-tetrazolium]-bis (4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate assay and defragmentation of deoxyribonucleic acid on MCF-7 cells after incubation with particles indicate relatively low cytotoxicity

Publication: 1.1. 1 Nanomaterials It is accepted to consider under the nanocrystal, nanostmctural, nanophase materials (NM) such materials, which size of crysta11ites or grains or particles that form their structural base, does not exceed 100nm (1000 A) at least in one dimension. Nanomaterials can be metals, ceramics, polymeric materials, or composite materials. The unit of nanometer derives from a Greek word" nano" meaning dwarf or extremely small. One nanometer spans 3-5 atoms lined up in a rowL By comparison, the diameter ofa human hair is about 5 orders of magnitude 1arger than a nanoscale particle. Nanomaterials are not simply another step in miniaturization, but a different arena entirely: the nanoworld lies midway between the scale of atomic and quantum phenomena, and the scale of bulk materials. At the nanomaterial level, some material properties are affected by the laws of atomic physics, rather than …

Authors:E Omurzak, T Mashimo, S Sulaimankulova
Publication_date: Synthesis of wurtzite-type ZnS nanoparticles by an electric discharge submerged in molten sulfur is reported. By the pulsed plasma between two zinc electrodes of 5 mm diameter in molten sulfur, we have synthesized high-temperature phase (wurtzite-type) ZnS nanocrystals with an average size of about 20 nm. Refined lattice parameters of the synthesized wurtzite-type ZnS nanoparticles were found to be larger than those of the reported ZnS (JCPDS 36-1450). UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy analysis showed that the absorption peak of the as-prepared ZnS sample (319 nm) displays a blue-shift comparing to the bulk ZnS (335 nm). Photoluminescence spectra of the samples revealed peaks at 340, 397, 423, 455 and 471 nm, which were related to excitonic emission and stoichiometric defects.

50. Synthesis and effect of pulse duration on formation of hollow carbon nano-onions by the pulsed plasma in liquid
Citations: 
Authors:Emil OMURZAK
Publication_date: A number of carbon nano-onions (CNOs) synthesis methods such as arc discharge [1], laser ablation [2], plasma [3], and chemical vapor deposition [4, 5], detonation and annealing of nanodiamonds [6] have been reported. There are drawbacks or limitations to the above methods such as the need for vacuum/cooling systems, high energy/temperature, catalysts/templates, or limitations due to high handling risks. We report energy and cost efficient preparation of hollow CNOs by the pulsed plasma [7] between graphite electrodes submerged in liquid. The effect of pulse duration on the formation of carbon nano-onions under the pulsed plasma in liquid conditions was studied. The sample synthesized using a 40-kHz frequency pulsed plasma with a pulse duration of 5 µs shows more carbon shells (10–30) than the sample prepared at 40 kHz with 12 µs (2 to 10). High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and …

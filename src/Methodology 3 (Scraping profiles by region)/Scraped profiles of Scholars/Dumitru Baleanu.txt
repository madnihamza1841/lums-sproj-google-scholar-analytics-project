Publication: In this work, we study the fractional order Lane-Emden differential equations by using the reproducing kernel method. The exact solution is shown in the form of a series in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Some numerical examples are given in order to demonstrate the accuracy of the present method. The results obtained from the method are compared with the exact solutions and another method. The obtained numerical results are better than the ones provided by the collocation method. Results of numerical examples show that the presented method is simple, effective, and easy to use.

Publication: In this paper we investigate the transport equations in fractal porous media by using the fractional complex transform method. The local fractional linear and nonlinear transport equations with local fractional time and space fractional derivatives are obtained. The proposed models adequately describe the fractal transport processes.

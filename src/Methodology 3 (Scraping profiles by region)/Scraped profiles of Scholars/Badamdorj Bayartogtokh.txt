Publication_date: 2012/6/22
Publication: This paper deals with the oribatid mites of Achipteriidae, one of the common families in Mongolia and the Russian Far East. The family is represented by six and fourteen species in Mongolia and the Russian Far East, respectively. In this work, we studied six recently collected species in detail, and their supplementary descriptions with precise illustrations are presented. We briefly discuss the species validity of Achipteria nitens (Nicolet, 1855), as well as the generic placement of Parachipteria nivalis (Hammer, 1952) and P. bella (Sellnick, 1928). Furthermore, we present data on habitat ecology, distribution and diversity of all achipteriid species in various areas of Mongolia and the Russian Far East, and provide a key for the identification of hitherto recorded species in these regions. The majority of achipteriid species found in Mongolia and the Russian Far East are known to be widely distributed in the vast areas of the northern hemisphere. Only three species have restricted distributions in the Russian Far East, Siberia and Mongolia. Most species of Achipteriidae in Mongolia and the Russian Far East are inhabitants of the litter of various forests, soils of grasslands or mosses growing on rocks or on forest floor; only two species seem to be arboreal inhabitants.

Publication_date: 2005
Publication: Composition, abundance, distribution, and diversity of oribatid mite communities were investigated at five study areas in Eastern Mongolia. A total of 88 species of oribatid mites were recorded from the studied areas. The largest number of species (51 spp.) was found in the habitats of river valleys, while the plain steppe which covers the largest area contained the lowest species richness (24 spp.). Three other sub-regions with similar landscape types show approximately the same species richness (39 to 45 spp.), although they are located relatively far from each other. The oribatid mite faunas of all sub-regions were essentially similar to each other.

Authors:Badamdorj Bayartogtokh, Heinrich Schatz, Barbara M Fischer, Ilya E Smelyansky
Publication_date: 2011
Publication: The present paper deals with a species of oribatid mite, Hemileius humeralis Pérez-Iñigo jr., 1990, which was previously known from the Mediterranean region, and was recently found in the high mountains of Central Europe and Central Asia. The species is redescribed with detailed illustrations based on adults. Its ecology and geographical distribution places this species in varying habitats from high alpine meadow to lowland grassland in the western Palaearctic region. An extensive discussion on the taxonomic status of Simkinia and Hemileius is provided. Both taxa are treated here as subgenera of Scheloribates. Data on the biogeography of the members of these subgenera are discussed. It seems that the range and habitats of known species of Scheloribates (Simkinia) are in accordance with the concept of the Old Mediterranean Region. The majority of species of Scheloribates (Hemileius) show restricted distributions within one biogeographical region, mainly in the Palaearctic, Nearctic or Neotropical regions. The Mediterranean area is outstanding by a high species diversity.

Publication_date: 2005
Publication: In the present paper, we describe the community structure, species diversity, population density, and the character of distribution of soil microarthropods of the Gobi Gurvan Saykhan mountains. In total 45 species of soil microarthropods belonging to 37 genera and 24 families were identified. Twenty-seven species of soil microarthropods belonging to 25 genera and 20 families were found in the Züün Saykhan, 31 species belonging to 27 genera and 19 families in the Dund Saykhan. Oribatid mites are the dominant group (35 species= 77.8% of total species richness), while mesostigmatid mites account for 7 species (15.6%). Other groups are represented only by single species. Population density of soil microarthropods is 3,600 ind/m 2 in the Züün Saykhan, 3,350 ind/m 2 in the Dund Saykhan, and 1,400 ind/m 2 in the Baruun Saykhan. Species diversity is almost similar in Züün Saykhan and Dund Saykhan (D= 14.36 and D= 14.96, respectively), but quite lower in Baruun Saykhan (D= 2.94). Faunal similarity between Züün and Dund Saykhan is 30%, while similarities between Baruun Saykhan and the other two ranges is 0.18% and 0.15%, respectively. Species distribution is clumped in the Züün and Dund Saykhan (I p> 0), but irregular in the Baruun Saykhan (I p≈ 0). The fauna of soil microarthropods in the Gobi Gurvan Saykhan mostly consists of species with wide distributions (Holarctic, Palaearctic, and cosmopolitan). However, 24.4% of the species are inhabitants of coniferous forests. Therefore, they might be regarded as indicators for the former presence of coniferous forests in the Gobi Gurvan Saykhan mountains.

Publication_date: 2016
Publication: The present paper deals with two species of oribatid mites of the genus Trichoribates Berlese, 1910 from the subalpine zone of high mountains in Central Japan. Trichoribates aokii n. sp. and Trichoribates hirauchiae n. sp. are proposed on the basis of adults. The first species is characterized by narrow lamellar cusps and translamella, and very closely situated notogastral setae h2 and h3. The second species is readily distinguishable from other closely related species by the specific structure of porose areas A1 and A2, the larger body size, the longer interlamellar and rostral setae, and anteriorly converging lamellae. A key to the Japanese species of Trichoribatesis provided along with data on their geographical distribution and habitat ecology.

Publication: A new species of oribatid mite belonging to the genus Epidamaeus is described from litter of birch forest in central part of Mongolia. Epidamaeus khustaiensis sp. nov. can be distinguished from its congeners by the strongly developed tectum of podocephalic fossa, the absence of propodolateral apophyses, the different size of spinae adnatae, the densely barbed and flagellate notogastral setae, the relatively small parastigmatic tubercle Sp, the conspicuously barbed anal and adanal setae and the different number of setae on femora I, III and on tarsus III. In addition, a known species, Dyobelba biclavata Wang et Norton is redescribed, Which is recorded for the first time from Mongolia. Some data on geographic distribution of known species of the genera Epidamaeus and Dyobelba are discussed.

Publication_date: Bayartogtokh, B., Grobler, L. & Cobanoglu, S. 2000. A new species of Punctoribates (Acari: Oribatida: Mycobatidae) collected from mushrooms in Turkey, with remarks on the taxonomy of the genus. Navors. nas. Mus., Bloemfontein 16 (2): 17-32. A new species of oribatid mite Punctoribates angulatus spec. nov., collected from mycorrhizal mushrooms in Turkey, is proposed and described on the basis of adults. Taxonomic problems concerning the type species, P. punctum (Koch, 1839) are discussed. The following new combinations are proposed: Minguezetes insignis (Berlese, 1910) comb. nov, Minguezetes longiporosus (Balogh, 1963) comb. nov, Minunthozetes perlongus (Balogh, 1959) comb. nov, Semipunctoribates zachvatkini (Shaldybina, 1969) comb. nov. and Semipunctoribates astrachanicus (Shaldybina, 1973) comb. nov.(Acari, Oribatida, Mycobatidae, Punctoribates, taxonomy, Turkey)

Citations: 
Authors:B Bayartogtokh
Publication_date: ABSTRACT ln the course of study on the species diversity and ecology of oribatid mites of Mongolia one interesting species belonging to the genus Pelaribates was found and is described here as new to science. The new species, Pelaribates angulatus differs from the closely related species by the relatively long and narrow head of sensillus, the diffe—rent number of genital setae; the presence of distinct angular projection on the lateral margins of ventral plate, the presence of network consisting numerous striations and muscle sigillae on the anterolateral part of notogaster, the different arrangement of notogastral setae and the larger body size.

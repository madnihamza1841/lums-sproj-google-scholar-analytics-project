34. Petri net based cluster and reachability analysis of the heat shock response in eukaryotes
Citations: 
Authors:Tseren-Onolt Ishdorj, Baatarkhuu Enkhtuya
Publication_date: From computer modelling point of view, biological system itself highly parallel, distributed, and concurrent mechanism in its functioning. On the otherhand, a software engineering formal method Petri net is widely used in modelling for distributed and concurrent systems. We consider a qualitative model based on Petri nets for the eukaryotic heat shock response introduced in [1]. The heat shock response (HSR) is a very well conserved defense mechanism against protein misfolding. The network includes mechanisms for feed-forward amplification, feedback regulation and stress-induced activation. In the present paper based on a recently introduced clustering approach for biochemical Petri nets, we explore and identify the main functional, biologically-relevant modules of the heat shock response model. We also explore its reachability properties and interpret them in terms of viability of the heat shock response.

35. Inhibiting/De-inhibiting P Systems with Active Membranes
Citations: 
Authors:Mihai Ionescu, Tseren-Onolt Ishdorj
Publication_date: This paper deals with P Systems with active membranes in which the computation is controlled by inhibiting and de-inhibiting rules. The inhibiting/de-inhibiting mechanism is inspired from the functioning of neural systems, and was first investigated in [4]. Now we join this mechanism with the features of active membranes, obtaining in this way a very simple way to reach computational universality. An efficiency result dealing with SAT problem is also presented.

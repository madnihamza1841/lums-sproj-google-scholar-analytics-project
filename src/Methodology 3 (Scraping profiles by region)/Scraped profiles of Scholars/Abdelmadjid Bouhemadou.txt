Publication: We report ab-initio density functional theory calculations of the electronic and optical properties of the spinel oxides GeMg2O4, GeZng2O4 and GeCd2O4 using the full potential linearized augmented plane-wave method. To calculate the electronic properties, the exchange-correlation interaction was treated with various functionals. We find that the newly developed Tran–Blaha modified Becke–Johnson functional significantly improves the band gap value. All considered GeB2O4 compounds are direct band gap materials. The band gap value decreases with increasing atomic size of the B element. The decrease of the fundamental direct band gap (–) when one moves from GeMg2O4 to GeZn2O4 to GeCd2O4 can be attributed to the p–d mixing in the upper valence bands of GeZn2O4 and GeCd2O4. The lowest conduction band, which is mainly originated from the s and p states of the Ge and B (B= Mg, Zn, Cd) atoms, is well dispersive, similar to that of transparent conducting oxides such as ZnO. The topmost valence band, which is originated from the O-2p and B-d states, is considerably less dispersive. Optical spectra in a wide energy range from 0 to 30 eV are provided and the origin of the observed peaks and structures are assigned. We find that the zero-frequency limit of the dielectric function (0) increases with decreasing band gap value.

Publication: The structural, electronic, magnetic and elastic properties of the ternary chalcogenides KMnQ2 (Q= O, S, Se, Te) crystals were investigated by means of spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. The 3d orbitals of the Mn atoms were treated using the GGA+ U approach. The calculated equilibrium structural parameters agree well with the experimental data. Based on the analysis of the spin-polarized band structures and density of states, we predict the half-metallic character of the studied compounds, with a half-metallic gap of 1.38 eV, 0.53 eV, 0.37 eV and 0.14 eV for KMnO2, KMnS2, KMnSe2 and KMnTe2, respectively, and a total magnetic moment of 4.00 μB per unit-cell for all considered structures. The examined properties for the title compounds include also the single-crystal elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio.

Publication: The structural properties of undoped and Zn-doped lead iodide (PbI2 nanostructures of different dopants weights have been investigated. Undoped and different Zn-doped PbI2 were grown successfully by thermal evaporation method using substrate of glass at room temperature. The dislocation density and particle size are elaborated in addition to energy band gap. The quantum dots potential, refractive index and optical dielectric constant are calculated, this leads to investigate nanoelectronics of quantum dots for solar cells applications. A careful analysis of the absorption coefficients has indicated the band gap. The obtained results are in good agreement with experimental and theoretical data.

Publication: A first-principles technique capable of describing the state accurately near to excited states of semiconductors and insulators, namely the modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) exchange potential approximation is used to investigate the opto-electronic response of magnesium spinel oxides: MgAl {sub 2} O {sub 4} and MgGa {sub 2} O {sub 4}. The predicted bandgaps using the mBJ exchange approximation show a significant improvement over previous theoretical work using the common LDA and GGA, and are very closer to the experimental results. Band gap dependent optical parameters, like dielectric constant, index of refraction, reflectivity and optical conductivity are calculated and analyzed. The static dielectric constant and refractive index of MgGa {sub 2} O {sub 4} are much larger than that of MgAl {sub 2} O {sub 4}. Refractive index drops below unity for higher energy photons, higher than 17 eV, show that the velocities of incident photons are greater than the velocity of light. However, these overlook can be explained by the fact that a signal must be transmitted as a wave packet rather than monochromatic wave. Moreover, the peak positions of the calculated optical parameters move down to low energies when the value of the band gap decreases. This comprehensive theoretical study of the optoelectronic properties predicts that these materials can be effectively used

Publication: A density functional-based method is used to investigate the structural, elastic and thermodynamic properties of the cubic spinel semiconductors MgIn {sub 2} S {sub 4} and CdIn {sub 2} S {sub 4} at different pressures and temperatures. Computed ground structural parameters are in good agreement with the available experimental data. Single-crystal elastic parameters are calculated for pressure up to 10 GPa and temperature up to 1200 K. The obtained elastic constants values satisfy the requirement of mechanical stability, indicating that MgIn {sub 2} S {sub 4} and CdIn {sub 2} S {sub 4} compounds could be stable in the investigated pressure range. Isotropic elastic parameters for ideal polycrystalline MgIn {sub 2} S {sub 4} and CdIn {sub 2} S {sub 4} aggregates are computed in the framework of the Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation. Pressure and thermal effects on some macroscopic properties such as lattice constant, volume expansion coefficient and heat capacities are predicted using the quasi-harmonic Debye model in which the lattice vibrations are taken into account.

Publication_date: 2009/6/22
Publication: Using first-principles density functional calculations, the structural, electronic, elastic and optical properties of cubic spinel SiGe {sub 2} N {sub 4} were studied by means of the full-relativistic version of the full-potential augmented plane wave plus local orbitals. We employed both the generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), which is based on exchange-correlation energy optimization to calculate the total energy, and the Engel-Vosko formalism, which optimizes the corresponding potential for band structure calculations. The calculated bulk properties, including lattice parameters, bulk modulus and their pressure derivatives, are in reasonable agreement with the available data. We have determined the full set of first-order elastic constants and their pressure dependence, which have not been calculated and measured yet. Band structure, density of states and pressure coefficients of energy band gaps are given. The obtained results for band structure using EV-GGA are larger than that of GGA. We calculated the frequency dependent complex dielectric function epsilon {sub 2}(omega) for radiation up to 30 eV. The assignment of the critical points to the band structure difference at various points of the Brillouin zone was made. The pressure and volume dependence of the static dielectric constant and the refractive index were calculated.

The calculated equilibrium structural parameters are in good agreement with the available experimental data ones when the latter are available. We have investigated the thermodynamic properties of the Ca2OsH6 system in the temperature range from 0 to 1000 K and the pressure range from 0 to 12 GPa using the quasi-harmonic Debye model as implemented in the Gibbs program. We have successfully obtained the temperature and pressure dependence of the lattice constant, bulk modulus, thermal expansion, the constant volume heat capacity and constant pressure heat capacity as these are essential for crystal growth.

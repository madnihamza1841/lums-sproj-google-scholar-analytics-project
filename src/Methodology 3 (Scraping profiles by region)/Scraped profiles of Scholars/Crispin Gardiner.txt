Publication_date: 2004
Publication: The observation of irregular motion of a small particle in a liquid gives one of the most direct indications of the existence of the random motion of molecules in a liquid, and thus indirectly of the existence of atoms. Einstein [5] gave the first correct explanation of this phenomenon as follows.
It must clearly be assumed that each individual particle executes a motion which is independent of all other particles; it will also be considered that the movements of one and the same particle in different time intervals are independent processes, as long as these time intervals are not chosen too small. We introduce a time interval− into consideration, which is very small compared to the observable time intervals, but nevertheless so large that in two successive time intervals−, the motions executed by the particle can be thought of as events which are independent of each other.

Publication: From analysis of the inelastic e-p scattering data it is found that an important feature of the parton probability function P(N) is that it should be peaked around some small number of partons. The most probable number of partons is prognosticated to be around 4.5. Contrary to the usually accepted forms of P(N), where it decreases uniformly from a maximum, it is found that the data also allow a behavior of P(N) where it rises to a maximum first and then decreases with increase of N.

Citations: 
Authors:C Gardiner, P Zoller
Publication_date: The Industrial Revolution that took place during the period from the latter part of the 18th to the early part of the 19th centuries saw a fundamental change in the human condition. In what was to become the developed world mankind moved from a predominantly rural society largely based on agriculture, where most people worked at home or in small shops with hand tools or simple machines, to one which was increasingly urban and based on industry. The factories that were developed to house the new complex machines now also became the place of work for many. Built upon the twin inputs of coal and iron, the machines of the factories and the new technologies were firmly based on the theoretical pillars of classical physics: Newtonian mechanics, thermodynamics and electrodynamics. Indeed, in the cases of thermodynamics and electromagnetism, advances in the fundamental science often went hand in hand with advances in the technological applications. As we moved into the twentieth century, classical physics gave way to quantum physics, and by the latter half of that century, The Information Age in which we still live was beginning. With hindsight its advent can perhaps be dated to the invention of the germaniumbased transistor, for which William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain won the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics. The now ubiquitous integrated circuit or microchip was independently invented and developed by Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce only ten or so years later, although the Nobel Committee was slow in awarding the Physics Prize to Kilby in 2000, by which time Noyce had already died ten years previously. Whereas …

195. Coherent light spectroscopy of Bose-Einstein condensates
Citations: 
Authors:PB Blakie, RJ Ballagh, CW Gardiner
Publication_date: Bragg scattering of Bose-Einstein condensates was pioneered by the NIST group in 1999 [1]. The essence of this technique is that a condensate, subject to a periodic potential arising in the region of overlap of two lasers, can be scattered into a selected momentum state by adjusting the light field parameters. Later that year Ketterle’s group at MIT reported a set of experiments where low intensity Bragg pulses were applied to a condensate and the imparted momentum was measured-a scheme they called Bragg spectroscopy [2, 3]. They analysed those results as a measurement of the dynamic structure factor for the system, and extracted difficult to measure information relating to the condensate momentum distribution and excitation spectrum. For low momentum transfers the rate of condensate excitation was suppressed, an effect which the authors attributed to correlated pair excitations, and quantum depletion of …

196. Vortex lattice formation and decay
Citations: 
Authors:AA Penckwitt, RJ Ballagh, CW Gardiner
Publication_date: Since the first experimental observation of vortices in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)[1] the nucleation process of vortices in BEC has been a matter of considerable current interest. Recent experiments have demonstrated the formation of highly-ordered vortex lattices in rotating BECs [2]. Although it is known that in stationary states multiple vortices are arranged in geometrical patterns, the dynamical mechanism of this ordering process is a matter of some conjecture.
To simulate the dynamics of a rotating condensate we have developed a formalism that models the transfer of atoms between the condensate and the thermal cloud, thus providing a dissipative mechanism. The formalism is based on a phenomenological growth equation for a condensate that takes into account linear growth processes, by which an atom leaves the vapour and enters the condensate, and linear loss processes, by which an atom …

Publication_date: This volume contains most of the papers presented in the oral session of the 7th Kyoto Summer Institute (KSI). on Dynamical Problems in Soliton Systems, held in Kyoto from August 27 to 31, 1984. Furthermore, it contains contributions of RK Bullough, HH Chen, AS Davydov, and N. Sanchez, who unfortunately could not attend. Thirty-six papers were presented in the oral session and 17 papers in the poster session. The meeting brought together 109 physicists and mathematicians, of which 22 were from abroad (see group photograph).
The KSI is an international meeting organized by the Research Institute for Fundamental Physics (RIFP), Kyoto University to discuss various curre nt problems of fundamental importance in theoretical physics. The 7th KSI was the first international meeting on solitons in Japan. Early in 1983, it was feit in the RIFP that the time was ripe for a conference dealing with problems concerning …

Publication_date: During recent years remarkably universal mechanisms have been found for the development of order from random distributions in active systems of quite different natures. These mechanisms are 1 inked to the propagation of strongly nonl inear waves, the so-called autowaves which are spatio-temporal analogs of auto-oscillations. While the auto-oscillation theory is a well-developed branch of science, the study of autowaves is still only in an embryonic state.
Among interesting examples of self-organization discovered in the study of the propagation of autowaves in active media is the occurrence of dissipative wave structures in quite different fields: the morphogenesis of the simplest multicellular organisms, the optic cortex, the retina, heart tissue, the Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical reaction. The autowave processes are also important in phase transitions, in particular for the disappearance of superconductivity, for …

202. Dynamical simulations of thermal Bose-Einstein condensates
Citations: 
Authors:MJ Davis, CJ Foster, AC Jacko, PB Blakie, SA Morgan, CW Gardiner, JJ Hope
Publication_date: The increasingly common “classical field approximation” uses the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) as a model of Bose-Einstein condensates at finite temperature, in much the same way as the highly occupied modes of the electromagnetic field can be treated classically. An essential part of the method is that there is a well-defined mode cutoff, so that only the highly-occupied modes are represented by the GPE. The eventual goal is the quantitative implementation of a computational method to simulate BECs in the presence of a significant thermal fraction. While necessarily being an approximate scheme, it is aimed at performing calculations for realistic experimental systems.
The method has continued to be developed for harmonically trapped systems, rather than for the somewhat idealised case of the homogeneous gas [1]. This is done by carrying out simulations using an efficient quadrature for the harmonic oscillator basis rather than on a computational grid. The Penrose-Onsager condition for BEC has been investigated for these systems, and we have found that to a good approximation condensate fractions can be determined by fitting bimodal distributions to single time momentum space density profiles, in a similar manner to experimental procedures. We have also calculated spatial correlation functions and observed the transition from coherent to thermal fluctuations further from trap centre. These results have recently been submitted for publication [2]. This method can also address the issue of critical fluctuations and the shift in the critical temperature in trapped Bose gases, a nontrivial calculation. The figure displays the results of a …

Publication_date: These proceedings contain the invited lectures presented at the International Symposium on Synergetics at Schloss Elmau in April, 1982. This symposium marked the 10th anniversary of symposia on synergetics, the first of which was held at Schloss Elmau in 1972. As is now weIl known, these symposia are devoted to the study of the formation of structures in physical systems far from thermal equilibrium, as weIl as in nonphysical systems such as those in biology and sociology. While the first proceedings were published by Teubner Publishing Company in 1973 and the second by North Holland Publishing Company in 1974, the subsequent proceedings have been published in the Springer Series in Synergetics. I believe that these proceedings give a quite faithful picture of the developments in this new interdisciplinary field over the past decade. As HJ Queisser recently noted, the prefix" non", which is used quite …

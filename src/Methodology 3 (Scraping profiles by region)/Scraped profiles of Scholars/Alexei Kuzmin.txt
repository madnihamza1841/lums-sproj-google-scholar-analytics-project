Publication_date: The effect of irradiation with GeV heavy ions (U, Au, Bi) on the structure and mechanical properties of MgO single crystals was studied. The methods of nanoindentation, dislocation mobility, optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy were used for damage characterization. The ion-induced increase of hardness and reduction of dislocation mobility was observed. The depth profiles of hardness, dislocation mobility and PL were investigated, and the contribution of electronic and nuclear loss mechanisms was confirmed. The efficiency of damage vs. average absorbed energy for heavy and light ions was compared. The change in the mechanism of plastic deformation at indentation was observed after severe irradiation due to the immobilization of dislocations by ion-induced extended defects. The results show that MgO single crystals maintain integrity and micro-plasticity at indentation, and exhibit improved hardness after irradiation with swift heavy ions at fluences up to 7× 1013 ions/cm2.

Publication_date: Copper monoxide (CuO) is a prototype compound for high-T c superconducting (HTSC) cuprates and is well suited to study the charge ordering phenomenon and compressibility of copper-oxygen bonds, which are crucial for the understanding of structure-property relationships in HTSC materials [1]. Electron-phonon and spin-lattice interactions play an important role in bulk CuO, which has monoclinic structure composed of CuO 6 octahedra strongly distorted by the Jahn-Teller effect. In particular, high-resolution XRD measurements [2] from 100 to 1000 K revealed anomalies in the lattice constants, appearing at the known antiferromagnetic phase transitions due to strong spin-lattice coupling. It was found recently [3] that small CuO nanocrystals with a size of~ 5 nm experience giant negative thermal expansion (NTE) below the magnetic ordering temperature (~ 200 K), in spite of their thermal expansion at high …

Publication_date: Artificial neural network (NN) was constructed and its training was performed using the off-the-shelf available NN implementation in Wolfram Mathematica 11.2 [1]. Schematically the used NN is depicted in Fig. 1 in the main text. It consists of (i) an input layer with ca 600 nodes, initialized with experimental or theoretical EXAFS data, mapped by Morlet wavelet transformation (WT)[2, 3] to (k, R)-space,(ii) two hidden layers with ca 600 nodes in each, and (iii) the output layer with 100 nodes, where the output values for different nodes correspond to a specific bin height in a histogram that parameterizes the radial distribution function (RDF) in the R-range between 2.0 Å and 6.0 Å. Bin width is 0.04 Å.
As explained in the main text, each node in the NN performs a simple operation: all its inputs x [n− 1](i) are weighted with some weights θ [n](i, j) and added together (unit feature x [n− 1](0)= 1 is appended to the input to account for bias term). Some non-linear, differentiable function (so called activation function) f is then applied to the sum, and the output x [n](j)= f (∑ x [i− 1](i) θ [n](i, j)) can then be similarly processed in the nodes in the consequent NN layers. As activation function for hidden layers we use hyperbolic tangent function, while linear function is used for the output nodes.

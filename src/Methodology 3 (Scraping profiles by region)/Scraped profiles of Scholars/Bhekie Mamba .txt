Cyanobacteria are a diverse group of photosynthetic organisms found mostly in freshwater bodies [1]. Cyanobacteria, apart from producing different useful metabolites for different applications such as pharmaceuticals, production of fine chemicals, biofertilizers and animal feed [2-5], they are known to produce lipophilic extractives such as fatty acids which are somewhat toxic to aquatic organisms, especisally unsaturated fatty acids. They are known to affect fish in freshwater bodies by interfering with the gill basolateral membrane ion-extrusion mechanisms leading to the death of fish [1, 6]. Thus, the toxicity properties of fatty …

Publication_date: 2013/12/9
Publication: This paper examines the link between corporate governance and earnings management (EM) of firms in some selected countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). A two-step estimation procedure using firm level data is applied. The first step employs a panel data estimation technique to analyze working capital discretionary accruals (WCDAC), a proxy for EM. Building on these results, the second stage examines the sources of EM, placing emphasis on the role of corporate governance and institutions. We find that EM of firms in Africa can be explained by the size of the board, its composition, return on assets, and debt ratio. In addition, our result reveals varying results as different corporate governance mechanisms affect EM across the various countries.

102. Corporate governance and dividend payout policy: evidence from selected African countries

Authors:J Abor, V Fiador
Publication_date: 2013
Publication: Purpose –
This study aims to examine the effect of corporate governance on firms' dividend payout policy in sub-Saharan Africa. The study also aims to examine how dividend payout influences corporate governance.
Design/methodology/approach –
Using a sample made up 27 Ghanaian firms, 177 Nigerian firms, 51 Kenyan firms, and 270 South African firms covering the period 1997-2006, the paper employs a simultaneous panel regression model in its estimation.
Findings –
The results show that board composition and board size exhibit significantly positive relationship with dividend payout in Kenya and Ghana, respectively. Institutional ownership positively influences dividend payout among South African and Kenyan firms. In the case of Nigeria, all the corporate governance measures show significantly negative effects on dividend payout. The findings clearly suggest that, with respect to South Africa, Kenya and Ghana, good corporate governance structures lead to high-dividend payout, probably due to easy access to and low cost of external finance. However, in Nigeria, improving the governance structures may be associated with high-earnings retention or low-dividend payment in order to reduce cost of external finance. We found in the case of Ghana that, dividend payout positively affects board composition, suggesting that Ghanaian firms with high-payout tend to adopt good corporate governance structures in order to ensure protection of shareholder interest. The findings of this study certainly have important policy implications.
Originality/value –
This present study contributes to the corporate governance literature by looking at the …

Publication: This study examines the relation between private capital flows and economic growth in Africa during the period 1990–2007. We estimate the empirical relation with a panel Instrumental Variable Generalized Method of Moments (IV-GMM) estimator which allows for arbitrary heteroskedasticity and endogeneity. Decomposing private capital flows into its component parts, we find that foreign direct investment, foreign equity portfolio investment and private debt flows all have a negative impact on economic growth. Countries with strong domestic financial markets, however, benefit more by being able to transform the negative impact of private capital flows into a positive one. Private capital flows, thus, promote economic growth in the presence of strong domestic financial markets. These results suggest that strong financial markets are needed for private capital flows to impact economic growth positively. Our results are robust to the control of population size, savings, financial openness and institutional quality.

Publication: This study examines SMEs’ access to bank finance and how that affects their export activities. The study adopts a probit model to assess the empirical relations. The findings of the study suggest that SME access to bank finance improves their likelihood to export. Such finance is critical to cater for the high fixed costs of exporting, international marketing and branding, and meeting higher quality standards required for overseas markets. The results of the study also indicate that older firms, more productive firms, and larger firms are more likely to take the important step of entering into the export market. Policy interventions should therefore be directed at reducing the bottlenecks that prevent SMEs from accessing funding from the commercial banks.

Publication: This paper sets out to explore the causality links between financial markets and foreign direct investment (FDI) in Africa. We use proxies for the banking sector and stock market to capture financial market development. We run separate estimations for the banking and stock market samples. Therefore, the sample size differs based on the sample being estimated. The banking sample is made up of 42 countries, whilst the stock market sample is made up of 16 countries. We use data covering the period 1970–2007 for the bank sample whilst for the stock market sample we use data covering the period 1990–2007. We use a 2SLS panel instrumental variable approach to obviate simultaneous causality bias. Our results suggest that a more advanced banking system can lead to more FDI flows. Also higher FDI flows can lead to the development of the domestic banking system. Countries with better-developed stock markets are likely to attract more FDI. We also find that FDI flows can lead to the development of the domestic stock market. Our results imply significant complementarities and feedback between financial markets and FDI in Africa.© 2012 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.

Publication: This study sought to find out the expectations of Ghanaian firms and some experts’ opinion on the possible implications of a West African monetary union for Ghanaian firms. The study revealed that most of the firms sampled for this study were aware of the intention to create a monetary union in the West African sub-region. With regards to the views of experts, they were very optimistic about the creation of the monetary union and were of the opinion that, synchronizing the economies would lead to a wider market, increased trade, and create opportunities for economies of scale. They however cautioned about the adverse socio-economic effects associated with the creation of such monetary unions.

Publication_date: This paper seeks to examine how financial literacy affects the relationship between financial inclusion and livelihood activities of people in Ghana. The empirical approach is conducted in two stages: first, to overcome the problem of self-selection and the attendant endogeneity problem, a biprobit model is employed to explore the relationship between financial inclusion, and individual and livelihood activities. Second, we use two stage least squares and robust probit methods to assess the impact of financial inclusion on income and livelihood activities respectively. We find the following results: The results first demonstrate that, financial education increases financial inclusion in Ghana and that, the level of financial knowledge individuals have accrued on how to manage their finance influence them to own and use their bank account for various transactions. Second, on the effects of inclusive finance on livelihood …

189. MID WESTERN GALAPAGOS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Citations: 
Authors:Joshua Abor, Inusah Musah
Publication_date: Galapagos is a relatively small country in Continentsix continent, roughly the size of Oregon with an estimated population of about 20 million. According to a recent UN estimates, between 20%-30% of the population mainly in urban Galapagos has access to potable water, making water supply an important political issue in this tropical nation. Experts believe that effective and efficient water supply can only be achieved via public-private-partnership (PPP), to which the government is receptive. An estimated US $2 billion investment is required to adequately address water problems.
The Galapagos State Water Co.(GSWC) is responsible for urban water supply while the Rural Water Supply Agency (RWSA) caters for the rest of the Galapagos society. The amount and distribution of rainfall is adequate but water resulting from traditional water harvesting and treatment techniques is insufficient and sometimes unwholesome for the densely populated urban communities including Nangala, the capital of Salinsahi province in Mid Western Galapagos which also happens to be the state capital. Moreover, the provision of treated water has been identified as one of the instruments for the promotion of healthy Galapagos.

Publication_date: The financial inclusion revolution is on. In this paper, we survey the new and expanding research on financial inclusion and the link between inclusive financial development and economic growth. We examine existing work on the conceptualisation, definition and measurement of financial inclusion, plus a description of the trends. We summarise the evidence so far on the determinants of, and barriers to, financial inclusion. We also assess the research findings on the link between inclusive finance and financial development, but further look into the effect of inclusive finance on economic growth. We highlight current knowledge on the role of institutional architecture in the financial inclusion-economic development nexus. We offer some concluding remarks, on the way forward for supporting financial inclusion in developing countries, such as the role of institutional quality, infrastructure and enabling policies.

192. Stop Firing the Guns! How Does Conflict interact with FDI to Influence Economic Growth?

Authors:Elikplimi Komla Agbloyor, Agyapomaa Gyeke-Dako, Alfred Yawson, Joshua Yindenaba Abor
Publication_date: This paper reexamines the relation between FDI and economic growth in sub Saharan African (SSA) after expunging the effect of conflict. We examine the empirical relations using a Two-Step System Generalized Methods of Moments (SGMM) estimator with orthogonal deviations, small sample size adjustments, and robust standard errors. We find that in the full sample FDI does not exert any influence on economic growth. However, when we drop countries that have been affected by conflict, we find in accordance with economic theory, that FDI has a positive influence on growth. Alternative approaches using dummy variables to represent countries that have been plagued by conflict and the years of conflict suggest that the effect of FDI on growth is lower in conflict-affected countries. Finally, we find empirical support for what we term the ‘repentant heart’hypothesis which we propound and test for the very first time. Countries that have entered into war only once, exited the war and never returned to war for a minimum of six years are able to benefit from FDI. Our findings provide further insights into and synthesize the findings from the absorptive capacity ‘school’and studies that have found no relation between FDI and economic growth. We conclude that developing countries can benefit from FDI, if they avoid violent conflicts. For countries that have already entered into war, avoiding a recurrence pays significant dividends. Indeed, they should ‘Stop Firing the Guns!’

194. A Managerial Approach for Developing Markets
Citations: 
Authors:Joshua Yindenaba Abor
Publication_date: Micro-, small-and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) have been noted as important contributors to the economic growth of many countries. Issues regarding MSMEs are therefore critical not only for the entrepreneur, but also for regulators, policy-makers, academics and the general public. Most start-up firms fail in their embryonic stage due to a multiplicity of factors, and especially so in sub-Sahara Africa. One of the main pandemics that plague small businesses is their lack of understanding of financial issues regarding their operations. Finance is critical for the survival of any entrepreneurial venture, and a good understanding of the financial issues confronting MSMEs will increase the chances of the entrepreneur surviving. Entrepreneurial finance deals with both institutional finance and finance as a structured approach to decision-making. Institutional finance is concerned with identifying the various sources of …

Publication_date: This article examines the gender composition of corporate boards of listed companies in Ghana. Results indicate that women were insignificantly represented and that younger firms had more women on their boards than firms established four decades ago. In addition, the study found that it is only after the initial listing that companies found it necessary to appoint women directors. As firms expand, they tend to employ fewer women on their corporate boards. Also, women were engaged more in the service and financial sectors than the manufacturing and construction industries. Interestingly, local companies appointed relatively more women as board members than their multinational counterparts.

Authors:Elikplimi Komla Agbloyor, Ransome Kuipo, Joshua Abor
Publication_date: This paper examines the channels through which foreign direct investment stimulates economic growth in host country economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. We employ a Generalized Methods of Moments estimator to account for the endogeneity of the regressors. We find that countries that guarantee high economic freedoms and possess good governance achieve better long-term growth outcomes. The results further indicate that the positive impact of FDI on economic growth depends on the quality of a country’s institutions. Thus institutional reforms though slow and painful should be pursued by SSA countries.

Publication_date: Previous studies, especially on large firms have shown that capital structure affects firm performance. Though the issue has been widely studied, largely missing from this body of literature is the focus on Small and Medium Enterprises. This paper examines the effect of debt policy (capital structure) on the financial performance of SMEs in Ghana and South Africa. Panel data analysis is used to investigate the relations between measures of capital structure and financial performance. Using various measures of performance, the results of this study indicate that capital structure influences financial performance, although not exclusively. By and large, the results of this study indicate that capital structure, especially long-term and total debt ratios, negatively affect performance of SMEs. This suggests that agency issues may lead to SMEs pursuing very high debt policy, thus resulting in lower performance. The main value …

Authors:Ryspek Usubamatov
Publication_date: 2017
Publication: Background and Objective:
The gyroscope theory and effects are represented by numerous researchers, with mathematical models based on the law of kinetic energy conservation and the change in the angular momentum of a spinning rotor. The main objective of this study is to find the unknown properties of the gyroscope.
Methodology:
The nature of gyroscope effects is more complex and known mathematical models and theories do not match the actual motions of the gyroscope effects. Latest investigations of forces that involved in motions of a gyroscope demonstrate that there are four dynamical components, which act simultaneously and interdependently with others. These forces of classical mechanics are the centrifugal, Coriolis and inertial forces and the force generated by the change in the angular momentum of the spinning rotor. The action of mentioned forces is represented the fundamental principle of gyroscope theory.
Results:
The gyroscope with the external torque applied is experienced the resistance torque generated by the centrifugal and coriolis forces of the spinning rotor and the precession torque generated by the inertial forces and the change in the angular momentum. Formulated mathematical model for gyroscope motion is based on action of eight torques of about two axis and they are generated by the gyroscope internal kinetic energy.
Conclusion:
It is concluded that the new developed mathematical model for gyroscope validated the theoretical approach.

Publication: In this paper design special frame vertical axis wind turbine and test in the wind tunnel. This design is presented as vertical locations of the three movable vanes that create scoop shape when closed. Scoop shape of frame increases the drag factor and increase the torque, in the other side of impeller movable vanes are opened under action of wind and the air pass freely to reduce the negative torque. Fabricate two models of impeller with movable vanes and with fixed vanes model and test it in wind tunnel. The maximum power coefficient for three frames movable vanes is 0.32 and higher than the same dimensions of model with fixed vanes about 11%.

78. Gyroscope Torques Acting on Rolling Disc
Citations: 
Authors:Ryspek Usubamatov
Publication_date: Recent investigations in gyroscope effects have demonstrated that their origin has more complex nature that represented in known publications. On a gyroscope are acting simultaneously and interdependently eight inertial torques around two axes. These torques are generated by the centrifugal, common inertial and Coriolis forces as well as the change in the angular momentum of the masses of gyroscope’s spinning rotor. The action of these forces manifests the internal inertial resistance and precession torques of gyroscopic devices. New mathematical models for the inertial torques demonstrate fundamentally different approaches for solving of gyroscope problems in engineering. This is very important because the stubborn tendency in engineering the increasing a velocity of rotating parts with different designs like turbines, rotors, discs and other rotating components leads to the proportional increase of acting forces that are expressed on their motions in space. This work considers a typical example of computing the action of internal inertial torques acting on the running disc.

79. Properties of Inertial Torques Acting on Gyroscopes
Citations: 
Authors:Ryspek Usubamatov
Publication_date: The gyroscopic devices are primary arrangements for navigation and control systems that the contemporary aerospace, ships and other industries have been widely adopted. The main remarkable property of the gyroscope is represented in permanent maintaining the axis of a spinning rotor in a space. This gyroscope property is the result of action of the several internal inertial torques produced by the external load torque. Internal inertial torques of the gyroscope are generated by action of the components of centrifugal, common inertial and Coriolis forces as well as the change in the angular momentum. These inertial forces are produced by rotating mass elements and the center mass of the spinning rotor. The action of all gyroscope’s internal torques are interrelated simultaneously around gyroscope axes, and are manifested the resistance and precession torques. The designers of gyroscopic devices can compute their acting forces and motions based on equations of the internal torques. However, gyroscope’s inertial torques possess several properties, which correct usage enables getting correct results in computing of gyroscope parameters. This manuscript describes the properties of the inertial torques acting on a gyroscope that should be used for mathematical models of the gyroscope motions.

Under such circumstances the power station authorities are obliged to undertake capital overhauling within short intervals which leads to the increment of forced outage and finally results in the shutdown of certain dependable high capacity units. In many Thermal Power Stations, interval between two consecutive overhauling has decreased to even less than one year. The contributing reasons to this technical drawback are mainly presence of impurities in river water, low grade quality of coal utilised in combustion inside the boiler, scale deposition resulting from the above mentioned factors, overheating due to improper adjustment of parameters in the instrumentation room and also sometimes due to improper quality of Tube material. All these technical issues occupy a vast and long term R&D domain for acute solution. But Condition Monitoring initiatives at Thermal Power Stations have selected Acid Cleaning as a fast hand remedy to this major problem during Capital Overhauling. It is already known that scale deposition is one of the severe factors for Boiler Tube Failure. When a deposition of 30-32 microns occurs then the tube is considered to have failed. Again, impurities present in the river water & coal contributes to a large extent towards Tube failure. Needless to mention that any remedial measures towards these consequences can only be adopted upon accurate analysis of causes of failure. Hence, this …

82. Analysis of a Coriolis Acceleration Ibrahim

Authors:R Usubamatov, KA Ismail, JM Sah
Publication_date: The velocity of a moving point in a general path is its vector quantity, which has both magnitude and direction. The velocity vector can change over time because of acceleration, which can be tangential, radial and Coriolis types. Acceleration analysis is important because inertial forces are proportional to their rectilinear, angular and Coriolis accelerations. The loads must be determined in advance to ensure that a machine is designed to handle these dynamic loads. For planar motion, the vector direction of acceleration is separated into the tangential, radial and Coriolis components of a point on a rotating body. The Coriolis acceleration is the product of linear and rotational velocities. All textbooks in physics, kinematics and machine dynamics consider the magnitude of a Coriolis acceleration at a common condition when an object moves and rotates at variable velocities. The magnitude of the Coriolis acceleration is considered on a basis of that common condition. However, the magnitudes of Coriolis acceleration vary according to the conditions of motions of an object. This paper presents new analytical expressions of the Coriolis acceleration under the conditions of uniform, accelerated and combined motions of an object and a rotating element and thereby fills a gap in the study of acceleration analysis.

Authors:Ryspek Usubamatov
Publication_date: Gyroscope devices are primary unit in navigation and control systems that have wide application in aviation, space, ships and other industries. The main property of the gyroscope device is maintaining its axis. This gyroscope peculiarity is represented in term gyroscope effects, which mathematical models formulated on the law of kinetic energy conservation and the rate change in the angular momentum of a spinning rotor. However, the nature of gyroscope effects is more complex and known mathematical models do not match the actual forces and motions in the gyroscope devices. Recent investigations in area of gyroscope theory demonstrate that in the gyroscope are acting four dynamical components simultaneously and interdependently, namely: the centrifugal, inertial and Coriolis forces and the change angular momentum in the spinning rotor. The applied torque to the spinning rotor generates the resistance torque based on centrifugal and Coriolis forces. The torque generated by the inertial forces and by the change of the angular momentum on the spinning rotor resulting in the precession torque of a gyroscope. The action of the resistance and precession torques is combined in case of solution the gyroscope problem. The new mathematical principles for the gyroscope motions are tested and the results practically validated. This paper represents the physical principles of motions in gyroscope devices.

Authors:H Kadhim, Ghulam A Quadir, Khairul A Ismail, U Ryspek
Publication_date: A thorough understanding of the principles of aerodynamics and structural dynamics of the rotor system is required for designing a wind turbine system that can generate power with high efficiency. The power generated by a Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) depends on the drag force generated by the individual blades and interactions between them in a rotating configuration. The present analysis is an attempt to predict numerically the coefficient of drag and other aerodynamic parameters for a three and four blades Vane type Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VVAWT) with different blades and vanes position. Commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics CFD softwares GAMBIT and FLUENT are used in the numerical analysis where the Shear Stress Transport (SST) k-ω turbulence closure model is used. The results are found to be similar in nature to those reported for VAWT having different blade designs.

Publication_date: Gyroscopes have a wide application in navigation and control systems of engineering. The main property of the gyroscope is maintaining the axis of a spinning rotor. This property is described by the mathematical model based on the law of kinetic energy conservation and changes in angular momentum. However, known mathematical models are intricate and do not match the practice of gyroscopes, but the nature of gyroscope effects is more complex. Recent investigations demonstrate that on a gyroscope are acting simultaneously and interdependently centrifugal, common inertial and Coriolis forces as well as changes in angular momentum. Centrifugal and Coriolis forces generate a resistance torque and common inertial forces and changes in angular momentum produce precession torque in gyroscopes. This paper represents physical principle of gyroscope’s gimbal motions that was as unsolved problem and described by a new mathematical model of acting forces. Analytical models well matched with results of practical tests.

Authors:Ryspek Usubamatov, Nor Zaiazmin Yahaya
Publication_date: In manufacturing area, one of the most complex technological processes is the machining of spiral bevel gears. For these processes, special machine tools designed with peculiar manuals for calculating the gear geometry, and the setting-up processes were developed. The known technologies and design of gear-cutting machine tools are different and based on processes that cut the concave and convex sides of the spiral tooth separately or simultaneously. These processes are different in productivity and quality of gear machining. Due to these circumstances, manufacturers created many modifications, with different qualities of the gear-cutting processes. Presently, there are following technologies: continuous indexing (face-hobbing) and single indexing (face-milling) that unlimitedly available to the user. This paper presents a new face-milling process of machining spiral bevel gears that can increase productivity and improve the quality of gears. The new process presents a solution that uses two cutter heads simultaneously for machining both concave and convex sides of the spiral teeth. Manufacturers can accept the new technology of the spiral bevel gear that needs a wide spectrum of research to get optimal solutions.

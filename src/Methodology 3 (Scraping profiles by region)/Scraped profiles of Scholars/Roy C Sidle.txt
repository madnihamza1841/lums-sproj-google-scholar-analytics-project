Publication_date: 1980
Publication: Surface erosion can be initiated by forest practices such as timber harvest, road construction, and site preparation. A variety of management and control measures can help reduce this erosion. Surface erosion is generated by soil and operational conditions that are conducive to or cause disturbance and compaction. By using good operational and management techniques to minimize the extent to which distmrbance and compaction occur, we can control the amount of surface erosion from managed forest lands, insure high standards of water quality, and protect the forest land base for future timber production.

Publication: Sedimentation of streams resulting from mass soil movement is the most important problem of non-point pollution in the Pacific Northwest, according to state and federal regulatory agencies. Sediment in streams contributes to the deterioration of fisheries habitat and affects downstream water quality. Large mass movements that extend downslope directly into streams can scour channels and alter aquatic ecosystems for decades. In order to minimize the impacts of forest practices on slope stability, forest and other resource managers must under-stand the characteristics and causes of various slope failures.

Publication: Large-scale disturbances associated with oil and mineral exploration, mining, road and right-of-way construction, residential development, and recreation activities are growing at a rapid pace. Both shallow and deep-seated land disturbances present formidable problems for successful long-term reclamation. Four initial questions concerning the nature of the surface disturbance must be answered to establish the physical and chemical constraints for the site: have extensive areas of the soil been disturbed or compacted and have these perturbations adversely affected hydrologic conditions; are slopes steep enough (usually > 25 degrees) that landslide potential is a concern; does a hazard of increased movement of undesirable chemicals into surface and groundwater exist; and/or is immediate stabilization of surface soils to prevent surface erosion necessary. The conceptual model for reclamation of surface …

Publication_date: 1982
Publication: Forest engineers must frequently make flood frequency estimates fo r very small watersheds when designing culvert installations. Empirical formulae and simplified rainfall runoff models, the most commonly use d techniques to predict floods from very small watersheds, require considerable engineering judgement to give reasonable results. As an alternative to such methods, this study presents equations to predict pea k flows on small watersheds in Oregon. The equations were developed from
80 watersheds ranging in size from 0. 21 to 10.60 square miles.

Publication_date: 2018
Publication: Intermittently Closed and Open Lakes or Lagoons (ICOLLs) are a subcategory of estuaries that exhibit limited exchange with the ocean and river flows. [1] This study focuses on improving hydrodynamic modelling in shallow water estuaries using GPS tracked Lagrangian drifter data. The inclusion of drifter data will improve hydrodynamic models, which are commonly used to assess and manage risks of flooding, sediment transport, and pollutants. Traditionally, Eulerian hydrodynamic models used in shallow water systems are calibrated using observations from fixed instruments. With the recent availability of inexpensive GPS tracked drifters that can be deployed in shallow estuaries [2], a higher density of data can be collected to improve the confidence in the hydrodynamic model outputs. The numerical model [3] is set up for an ICOLL in South East Queensland (Currimundi Lake).This model will be calibrated and validated using both Lagrangian and Eulerian data. The effectiveness of assimilated Lagrangian drifter data on improving the prediction of velocity and water heights in the ICOLL is investigated. The calibrated numerical model will further be used for modelling advection-dispersion of potential contamination, sediment transport, and flood modelling within the ICOLL.

Authors:B Mirus
Publication_date: 2017
Publication: The authors present a much needed discussion about some systematic problems with precipitation intensity-duration (ID) threshold approaches for predicting shallow landslides. In particular, they point out an unfortunate lack of reasonable constraints on the max/min duration of rainfall events, and also discuss how these unbounded events can affect the average intensity and predictive capabilities. Both issues are largely ignored in many studies focused on developing and testing ID thresholds, so it’sa worthy discussion about some crucial sources of error. The authors also highlight the potential C1 importance of hydrological information in addition to precipitation characteristics, which have not been systematically incorporated into landslide early warning criteria. In my opinion the most innovative contribution presented in the manuscript is the comparison of the rainfall intensity recurrence intervals and ID thresholds for landslide initiation from the literature, along with the contour lines of cumulative storm totals (Fig. 3). This is a new and intuitive way to broadly illustrate their point about some problems with the ID threshold concept. However, my primary concerns with the manuscript are twofold:

Publication_date: 2016/7/11
Publication: Background and Aims Little quantitative information is available on the protective role of tropical species on slope sites prone to erosive phenomena. One of the key parameters to evaluate of species’ capabilities in erosion mitigation is root individual scale mechanical traits. We explored, for the first time, the variability of root mechanics of several dominant species in tropical ecosystems. Methods We carried out ex situ experimental tests on roots of four common tropical tree species, i.e. Barringtonia fusicarpa Hu, Pometia pinnata J.R. Forst. & G. Forst., Baccaurea ramiflora Lour. and Pittosporopsis kerrii Craib as model species in Xishuangbanna forests, Yunnan, China. Tensile strength and modulus of elasticity, as two of the most important root mechanic traits were estimated. Results and Conclusions Root mechanics vary greatly depending on root size and tree species. And root size the primordial factor determining the variability of root mechanics, especially for very fine roots. The significant disparity of root mechanics between the four tree species suggests that the use of generic equations in soil stability modelling procedures may not be relevant in tropical ecosystems that possess a high species richness level. General discussions are provided concerning the disparity of geomorphological modelling between temperate and tropical forests.

Publication: Lagrangian field data in tidal shallow waters are rare, but valuable for the under - standing of the spatio-temporal structure flow and water qualities, validation and calibration of hydrodynamic models, and advection-dispersion models for such systems. Recent improvements in GPS technology have paved the way for the development of instrumented high resolution Lagrangian drifters capable of being deployed in shallow rivers and estuaries where processes of interest occur at small temporal (100 seconds) and spatial (few metres) scales.

Authors:Roy Sidle
Publication_date: 2007/11/7
Publication: While the importance of preferential flow in soils has been widely documented, it is not clear whether these pathways are continuous over long slope distances nor are the temporal aspects of preferential flow fully understood. Herein, concepts developed from numerous field-based investigations in Japan are summarized in the context of hillslope stormflow generation processes. In most forest hillslopes, individual soil macropores are relatively short (ie,< 0.5 m); nevertheless different types of macropores have a tendency to self organize into larger preferential flow systems as sites become wetter. Staining tests show clear evidence of interconnected macropore flow segments including: flow within decayed root channels and subsurface erosion cavities; flow in small depressions of bedrock; fracture flow in bedrock; exchange between macropores and mesopores; and flow at the organic horizon/mineral soil interface and in buried pockets of organic material and loose soil. The spatially variable and non-linear preferential flow responses observed at the Japan field sites as well as other sites are attributed to discrete segments of macropores connecting at various nodes within the regolith. Each node is activated by local soil water conditions and is strongly influenced by soil depth, permeability, pore size, organic matter distribution, surface and substrate topography, and possibly momentum dissipation. Thus, preferential flow contributes increasingly to storm runoff in headwater catchments during wetter conditions. In contrast, Hortonian overland flow, which may be significant when measured at smaller scales and during relatively dry antecedent …

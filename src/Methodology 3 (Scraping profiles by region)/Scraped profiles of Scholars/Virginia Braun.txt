Authors:Victoria Clarke, Naomi Moller, Nikki Hayfield, Virginia Braun
Publication_date: 2019/12/25
Publication: This chapter provides a critical review of the inter-disciplinary research on voluntary childlessness, examining some of the problematic assumptions that underpin the literature and the image of the childfree woman that emerges as a result. It is not intended as a comprehensive overview of this literature, but rather a feminist engagement with the frameworks and ideology that shape and limit it. One of the reasons why the motives, characteristics, and personality of women who choose to be childfree have been of interest to researchers is because there is a social assumption that having children is a natural human instinct. Pronatalist social ideologies frame parenting as deeply fulfilling, essential for human happiness and a meaningful life, and a marker of a successful adulthood (Morison et al.; Moller and Clarke). Furthermore, there is a social equation of motherhood and femininity, a ‘motherhood imperative’ (Giles et …

147. Does body hair removal remain a domain of embodied gendered difference? A report from Aotearoa New Zealand.
Citations: 
Authors:Gareth Terry, Virginia Braun
Publication_date: 2013/7/11
Publication: In relatively recent Anglo-western history, body hair removal has been a strikingly gendered phenomenon: women remove body hair; men do not. In the last decade, claims have been made of a “recent neutralization of differences in hair practices between the genders” – a shift towards men also removing hair, rather than women stopping removing hair. Anecdotal and some empirical evidence suggests significant cultural changes in men’s hair removal practices, but men’s practices, and their relationship to the ‘hairless ideal’ still expected of women in Anglo-western countries, remain relatively under-examined. We sought to explore whether body hair removal remains as a key domain of embodied gendered difference. Here we report on a mix of qualitative and quantitative data collected via an online survey from 584 New Zealanders between the ages of 18-35 (mean age 26, 48.9% male, 50.6% female, 0.5% other, demographically diverse). Women’s hair removal practices echo that found in other research, with high levels of hair removal. Men also appear to remove hair in substantial proportions, from multiple body sites. Through exploring concepts like acceptability and desirability, a complex and gendered picture of body hair practice appears, captured by the notion of flexibility. For women, hair removal appears still a mandatory requirement for desirable (hetero)femininity; for men, however, hairiness/hairlessness boundaries appear more flexible, less clearly tied to desirable (hetero)masculinity.

Publication_date: Pubic hair removal, now common among women in Anglo/western cultures, has been theorized as a disciplinary practice. As many other feminine bodily practices, it is characterized by removal or alteration of aspects of women’s material body (ie, pubic hair) considered unattractive but otherwise ‘natural’. Emerging against this theorization is a discourse of personal agency and choice, wherein women assert autonomy and selfmastery of their own bodies and body practices. In this paper, we use thematic analysis to examine the interview talk about pubic hair from eleven sexually and ethnically diverse young women in New Zealand. One overarching theme–pubic hair is undesirable; its removal is desirable–encapsulates four themes we discuss in depth, which illustrate the personal, interpersonal and sociocultural influences intersecting the

Publication_date: Der Mediensektor befindet sich allem Anschein nach erst am Anfang einer langwährenden Zeit der Veränderungen, Umbrüche und Verwerfungen. Die Vorhersage künftiger Entwicklungen kann niemand leisten–wir sind darauf verwiesen, Veränderungen zu erkennen, zu verstehen und zu bewerten und vorsichtig Tendenzen abzuschätzen. Diese sind gegenwärtig in verschiedenen Tatsachen zu sehen: Im forcierten Wettbewerb um Zeitbudgets, Gunst und Aufmerksamkeit, in der Fragmentierung als auch in der Auflösung von Massenpublika für Zeitungen, Zeitschriften und Rundfunkangebote, in der Verbreitung von massenhafter Gruppenkommunikation und disparater Nischenpublika usw. Tradierte Formen und Praktiken des Mediengebrauchs werden weiter Bestand haben, solange sie nicht durch überzeugende Vorteile im Gebrauch und in der Wirtschaftlichkeit neuer Entwicklungen ersetzt werden. So wissen Anbieter von Druckerzeugnissen und Veranstalter des herkömmlichen Rundfunks um ihre virulente Bedrohung, die jedoch erst mit der Durchsetzung neuartiger effizienter Geschäftsmodelle der digitalen Welt vehement einsetzen wird. 1, 2
Die Veränderungen im gesellschaftlichen Mediensystem werden durch viele Einflussfaktoren und deren Wechselwirkungen befördert: Nutzungsangebote und-arten, Medienpolitik, Märkte–und alles wird vorangetrieben durch permanente technische Entwicklungen. Technik ist dabei wesentlich, aber nicht allein bestimmend–sie ist weder autonomer noch einheitlicher Faktor, jedoch Ausgangspunkt immer subtilerer Versuche, Konsumenten an Geräte, Systeme und Geschäftsmodelle dauerhaft zu binden.

Publication: Building on theoretical discussions regarding the institution of heterosexuality and heteronormativity, this chapter demonstrates how language and heterosexual sex (that is, heterosex) are intimately intertwined. The chapter teases out the ways in which the norms of heterosexuality have changed over time yet also remained the same in several fundamental ways. The first section maps the broad discursive conditions that shape dominant norms of contemporary heterosexuality in Anglo-Western contexts. The second section demonstrates the cultural imperatives that govern the desires, norms, and acts of heterosex, outlining how they create specific modes of being and doing in everyday practice. Finally, the conclusion considers the possibility that recent global activism may lead to a revamping of gendered norms and their tired rigidity.

173. Selling a Perfect Vulva? Selling a ‘Normal’Vulva!
Citations: 
Authors:Virginia Braun
Publication_date: It’s entirely within everyone’s rights to make alterations to their body for whatever reason, and many people with vaginas undergo surgery to deal with pain and discomfort caused by longer labia. It’s just a shame that there seems to be a trend for labiaplasty done purely for cosmetic reasons, to fit an ideal of what the vulva ‘should’look like [1].
Such opening sentences to an article (about labiaplasty) would have been unimaginable not that long ago. Not anymore. For almost 20 years, the ‘designer vagina’–genital cosmetic surgery for the vagina and vulva–has been part of public discourse and material practice. We now have a generation of young adults who have developed body and genital awareness, genital aesthetic preferences and indeed ideas and expectations about genito-sexuality, in a context in which surgical and nonsurgical interventions to alter form and function of the vulva/vagina just are. This creates a …

Publication_date: Orgasm is a ‘goal’of much sexual activity, a source of potentially intense pleasure and fulfillment, yet can be fraught with difficulty or distress. Relatively little social science research has explored people’s experiences around, and their meanings related to, orgasm, and indeed other sexual pleasures, especially with young adults. This study aimed to provide a rich exploration of the meanings associated with orgasm and sexual pleasure during sex with a partner, to understand the social-patterning of orgasm experience. A qualitative survey was used to collect data from 119 sexually-experienced British young adults (81% women, mean age 20; 92% heterosexual). A descriptive form of thematic analysis that prioritizes participants’ meanings and experiences was used to identify and explore patterns in the data. Five main themes reported here are: 1) orgasm: the purpose and end of sex; 2)‘it’s more about my partner’s orgasm’; 3) orgasm: the ultimate pleasure?; 4) orgasm is not a simple physiological response; and 5) faking orgasm is not uncommon. These (mostly not gendered) themes demonstrate complex and contradictory meanings around orgasm, but also show meaning to be dependent on situation and context. However, they do resonate strongly with widespread discourses of sexuality which prioritize heterosexual coitus, orgasm, and orgasm-reciprocity.

177. “It Shouldn’t Stick Out from your Bikini at the Beach”: Meaning, Gender, and the Hairy/Hairless Body Virginia Braun and Gemma Tricklebank The University of Auckland Victoria Clarke
Citations: 
Authors:Virginia Braun
Publication_date: Women’s and men’s bodies and sexuality can be understood as socially-situated and sociallyproduced. This means they are affected by, and developed in relation to, patterned sociocultural meanings and representations. We aim here to understand a recently emergent, and potentially gendered, body practice—pubic hair removal—by examining the meanings people ascribe to pubic hair and its removal. Extending the widespread hairless bodily norm for Anglo/Western women, pubic hair removal is an apparently rapidly growing phenomenon. Men, too, are seemingly practicing pubic hair removal in significant numbers, raising the question of to what extent pubic hair removal should be understood as a gendered phenomenon. What we do not yet know is what people’s understandings and perceptions of pubic hair are, and how they make sense of its removal. Using a qualitative survey, the current study asked a series of questions about pubic hair and its removal, both in general and related to men’s and women’s bodies. In total, 67 participants (100% response rate; 50 female; mean age 29, diverse ethnically, predominantly heterosexual) completed the survey. Thematic analysis identified five key themes in the way people made sense of pubic hair and pubic hair removal that are related to choice, privacy, physical attractiveness, sexual impacts, and cleanliness. Meanings around pubic hair and its removal were not consistently gendered, but it was still situated as more of an issue for women. With potential impacts on sexual and psychological wellbeing, sexuality education provides an important venue for discussing, and questioning …

178. Warning voices in a policy vacuum: professional accounts of gay men’s health in Aotearoa New Zealand
Citations: 
Authors:Virginia Braun, Timothy McCreanor
Publication_date: Internationally, public health policy and practice are increasingly recognising and focusing on gay men’s health issues beyond HIV/AIDS. Against this background we consider how gay men’s health is understood and considered in Aotearoa New Zealand, including identification of problems, aetiology and possible solutions. Semi-structured interviews with key informants involved in diverse professional roles in areas related to health for gay men were undertaken and three overarching themes identified. First, informants identified gay men’s health as a legitimate area of concern within health policy. Second, they framed gay men’s health in biopsychosocial terms, but highlighted socio-political factors. Third, the informants suggested that broad health-promoting strategies, coupled with targeted strategies, are needed to improve gay men’s health. However, informants confirmed that there is very little mainstream policy interest in gay men’s health; similarly, they identified little interest in broader health issues within the gay community. These findings contrast with many international settings where health for gay men is an emerging area of policy concern and health promotion activity, in both mainstream and gay-specific settings. We argue that the invisibility of gay men within health policy contributes to disempowering gay men, which is likely to contribute to continued health disparities for gay men. To conclude, the policy implications of these findings are discussed.

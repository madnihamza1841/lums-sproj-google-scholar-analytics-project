Publication_date: 2013/1
Publication: Pregnancies which are too many, too early and too often result in maternal/child morbidity and mortality. Delivery of effective family planning services has a direct impact on maternal/child wellbeing. While access to health units was good and sensitization of communities was carried out, the contraceptive prevalence rate remained low in Iganga District, like in many parts of the country. This study was therefore conducted to assess client and health facility factors that contribute to missed opportunities for modern family planning service use among women attending child health clinics in Iganga/Mayuge Demographic Surveillance Site in order to inform policy and design of interventions that can improve uptake.

Publication_date: An approximate of 2.6 million stillbirths, 2.7 million neonatal deaths and 303,000 women die from pregnancy and childbirth related complications every year. Low and Middle income countries in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa bare the largest burden.
The INDEPTH Network has various potential roles to inform the global maternal and newborn agenda, and improving population-based birth outcome measurement but faces many challenges. Initial steps are in place to improve the measurement of pregnancies and their outcomes. Five HDSS sites with a population more than 30000, annual stillbirth rates and neonatal mortality rates greater than 15 per 1000 live births, high quality surveillance for birth outcomes, presence of expertise related to maternal, newborn health and stillbirth and evidence of co-funding were selected to participate in the Every Newborn Action Plan Improvement Measurement Roadmap collaborative study.

Publication: Objective: To analyse the impact of community approaches to improving newborn health and survival in low-resource countries.
Methods: We updated previous meta-analyses of published cluster randomized trials of community-based interventions for neonatal survival. For each study we extracted baseline data on the context: geographical area; available facilities and staffing; immediate breastfeeding and facility births; and neonatal mortality. We also extracted data on the primary outcome (neonatal survival) and intermediate outcomes of the interventions (changes in immediate breastfeeding and facility births). We used forest plots and pooled sub-group analysis to seek patterns in associations between the effect size and the context or type of intervention (home-based counselling or women’s groups).
Findings: We included 17 trials, spanning years from 2001 to 2013. A 25 per cent reduction in neonatal mortality (relative risk, RR: 0.75; 95 per cent confidence interval, CI: 0.69–0.80) was found when pooling six studies in settings with 44 or more deaths per 1,000 live births. In lower-mortality settings (pooling six studies with 32 or fewer deaths per 1,000 live births) there was no evidence of an effect. We observed some evidence that community approaches had a stronger effect in south Asia than in sub-Saharan Africa. Community approaches had a lower impact on neonatal mortality in settings where at least 44 per cent of women delivered in a facility.
Conclusion: As neonatal mortality declined, the impact of community approaches on survival appeared to be lower, and the role of these approaches in supporting newborn care in weak health …

Publication_date: Background:
Improving maternal and newborn health requires improvements in the quality of facility-based care. This is challenging to measure: routine data may be unreliable; respondents in population surveys may be unable to accurately report on quality indicators; and facility assessments lack population level denominators. We explored methods for linking access to skilled birth attendance (SBA) from household surveys to data on provision of care from facility surveys with the aim of estimating population level effective coverage reflecting access to quality care.
Methods:
We used data from Mayuge District, Uganda. Data from household surveys on access to SBA were linked to health facility assessment census data on readiness to provide basic emergency obstetric and newborn care (BEmONC) in the same district. One individual-and two ecological-linking methods were applied. All methods used household survey reports on where care at birth was accessed. The individual-linking method linked this to data about facility readiness from the specific facility where each woman delivered. The first ecological-linking approach used a district-wide mean estimate of facility readiness. The second used an estimate of facility readiness adjusted by level of health facility accessed. Absolute differences between estimates derived from the different linking methods were calculated, and agreement examined using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient.
Results:
A total of 1177 women resident in Mayuge reported a birth during 2012-13. Of these, 664 took place in facilities within Mayuge, and were eligible for linking to the census of the district's 38 …

Publication_date: BACKGROUND
Little is known about the accuracy of facility-based birth registry data for routine monitoring of birth outcomes. This report details the results of a data quality strengthening intervention aimed at improving completeness of birth registry data in Kenya and Uganda, as part of a package of interventions in an implementation science trial under the East Africa Preterm Birth Initiative.
METHODS
The intervention aimed to improve completeness of key intrapartum and post-partum data, including gestational age, birthweight, and newborn outcomes. We conducted data strengthening activities in 23 facilities in Uganda and Kenya. To test the effects of these interventions on completion of key variables, we compared completion rates at various time points.
RESULTS
In Uganda, the completion rate of all four fields of interest increased by 13%(95% CI: 10, 17) with the introduction of data quality training and mentoring. Documentation of the status of infant at discharge and gestational age increased by 12%(95% CI: 9, 14) and 22.3%(95% CI: 19, 17), respectively; while that of birthweight had a marginal increase of 3.2%(95% CI: 1, 5) and Apgar at 1 minute showed no significant change. In Kenya, there was no significant change in completion for most fields.
CONCLUSION
This study suggests that the data strengthening campaign had mixed effects on completion of facility-based maternity register fields and may be country specific. Given emerging international priorities around maternal and neonatal health, utilizing facility-based routine data sources will be key to ensuring sustainable monitoring and evaluation of interventions and outcomes.

Publication_date: 1. Background
“In the past fifty years, the world beyond North America and Western Europe has seen improvements in health care and living conditions as breathtaking in their sweep as the technological changes experienced in richer areas of the Northern Hemisphere”(p. 3). 1 That statement, based on data from about 25 years ago, is equally appropriate today. Health care has continued to improve at a remarkable pace, especially in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Life expectancy in low-income countries (LICs) increased from 39.1 to 50 between 1960 and 1992, and continued on a similar path to 61.3 by 2014. 2 Infant mortality in LICs is less than half of what it was in 1992. 3 The reasons for the improvements since 1992 are different from the reasons for the health care improvements in the decades before 1992, in many cases, because of the success of the preceding decades. Similarly, the reasons for improvement in the next 25 years can be expected to be different than those for the past 25 years, in large part because of the successes that have taken place over the past 25 years. Much of the focus has been on the actions and effects of multinational institutions and/or governments. However, much of the health care is provided by private health care institutions and there is no reason to believe that their impact will decrease in the future.
As part of the William Davidson Institute’s celebration of 25 years of market-based solutions, this paper reviews the changes that have taken place in health care delivery in low-and middle-income countries since 1992, highlighting the role of the private sector. This is an enormous task and in the …

Publication_date: This case-series study was done in the Iganga/Mayuge Demographic Surveillance Site (DSS) in Uganda. This DSS encompasses 67 000 people in 13 400 households. About 17% are children is aged less than 5 years. There is one hospital, eight public health centres, three nongovernmental organization (NGO) clinics, and 122 drug shops in the DSS. The site is a member of the international DSS organization InDepth and largely follows its standard methods. The DSS generates population-based data on key demographic events three times a year, and household, socioeconomic and education data once a year. Furthermore, community informants continuously relay information on deaths. All reported deaths in children aged 1–59 months in the DSS from November 2005 to August 2007 were included in the study. Collection and analysis of DSS data were ethically reviewed by Makerere University Institutional Review Board and approved by Uganda National Council of Science and Technology.

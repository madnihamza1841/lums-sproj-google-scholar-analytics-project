Publication_date: 2011/9/1
Publication: Electrodeposited zinc electrodes for high current zinc bipolar batteries have been prepared and studied on the basis of morphology, particle size, surface area, bulk density, current density, and specific energy density. Electrodeposition was performed in alkaline bath with copper as substrate. The material so developed was characterized by XRD, SEM, bulk density measurements, BET surface area and electrochemical discharge testing. The effect of ZnO and KOH concentrations, bath temperature, distance between electrodes and use of surfactants was studied on the morphology and electrochemical properties of the synthesized powders. Surfactant resulted in an increase in current density due to improved surface area. The discharge current capability upto 700mAcm-2 was achieved.

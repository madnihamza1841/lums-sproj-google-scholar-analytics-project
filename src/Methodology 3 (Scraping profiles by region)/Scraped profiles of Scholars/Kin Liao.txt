Authors:Erik Petersen, Gang Ma, Kin Liao, Kam W Leong
Publication_date: 2012
Publication: As a prelude to the understanding of mechanotransduction in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation, the mechanical behavior of hESCs in the form of cell pellet is studied. The pellets were tested after 3 or 5 weeks of cell culture in order to demonstrate the effect of the duration of cell culture on the mechanical properties of the pellets. A micromechanical tester was used to conduct unconfined compression on hESC pellet, and experimental, numerical, and analytical methods were combined to determine the mechanical properties of hESC pellet. It is assumed that the mechanical behavior of hESC pellets can be described by an isotropic, linear viscoelastic model consisting of a spring and two Maxwell units in parallel, and the Poisson’s ratio of the hESC pellet is constant based on pellet deformation in the direction perpendicular to the compression direction. Finite element method (FEM) simulation was adopted to determine the values of Poisson’s ratio and the five parameters contained in the viscoelastic model. The variations of Poisson’s ratio and the initial elastic modulus are found to be larger compared with those of the four other parameters. Results show that longer duration of cell culture leads to higher modulus of hESC pellet. The effect of pellet size error on the values of mechanical parameters determined is studied using FEM simulation, and it is found that the effect of size error on Poisson’s ratio and initial elastic modulus is much larger than that on the other parameters.

Publication_date: All reactions were carried out under N2. Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. 1H NMR (400 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) spectra were measured on Bruker AVⅢ 400M spectrometers with CDCl3 as solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard or 85% H3PO4 as external standard for 31P NMR (162 MHz). Chemical shifts were reported in units (ppm) by assigning TMS resonance in the 1H spectrum as 0.00 ppm and CDCl3 resonance in the 13C spectrum as 77.23 ppm. All coupling constants (J values) were reported in Hertz (Hz). Chemical shifts of common trace 1H NMR impurities (ppm): H2O: 1.56, CHCl3: 7.26. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel 300-400 mesh. The CAS number of the known compound was listed. The unknown products were further characterized by HRMS-ESI.

Authors:Y Ren, H Zhang, YQ Fu, F Li, HM Cheng, T Xiao, K Liao
Publication_date: In this paper, our work on studying the tensile strength of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) bundles, their fatigue, and time-dependent behavior are presented. Results from tensile testing of SWCNT bundles enable us to interpret the strength distribution of SWCNTs. The fatigue behavior of unidirectional, aligned SWCNT rope reinforced epoxy composite under tension-tension cyclic load was studied. Patterns of crack propagation under tension in a SWNT were also studied by molecular mechanics simulations. In addition, we will also present results of creep rupture tests of SWCNT bundles. Small bundles of SWCNT were tested under constant displacement until failure. Failure modes were examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Finally, we will present a life prediction scheme for SWCNT fatigue based and molecular simulation and kinetic fracture concept.

Publication_date: In this experimental research an extensive series of carbonaceous sorbents with different structural and porous characteristics were investigated for their solid-state H2 storage gravimetric capacity (wt%) through physical adsorption processes, in an attempt to address the main classes of carbon nanostructures that are currently receiving attention as potential H2 stores [1-3]. In this respect, both commercially available (carbon nanotubes, few-layer graphenes) and newly synthesized (graphene sponge, microwave-exfoliated graphene oxide) graphene-based and other carbon nanomaterials were examined. Their textural properties were determined by N2 adsorption at 77K; important parameters were extracted such as BET specific surface area, micropore volume and pore size distribution. Additional characterization techniques were employed in order to elucidate further their structural properties, such as X-Ray …

Publication_date: In this paper, the effects of graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles on glass fiber composite processing by incorporating them into epoxy resin were investigated. GO was synthesized from graphite powder and was mixed with epoxy resin. Three different GO contents of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 wt% were used. Epoxy/GO samples were tested for rheology and cure kinetics to evaluate the effects of GO content on important resin infusion processing parameters. The results show that adding GO to neat epoxy resin increased the viscosity and affected the resin cure reaction by reducing the resin gel time. After that, glass fiber composites were prepared using the resin infusion process. Samples with 0.2 wt% GO result in very slow resin infiltration time with premature resin gelation. A 30% increase in flexural strength and a 21% increase in flexural modulus are manifested by adding GO as the secondary reinforcement to glass fiber composites.

176. FABRICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CARBON NANOTUBE REINFORCED CHITOSAN MATRIX NANOCOMPOSITES
Citations: 
Authors:Raymond Gan, Hein San, Kean Wang, Kin Liao
Publication_date: The unparalleled mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) hold great promises as reinforcing filler for polymer-based micro-fibers [1]. Much work is on going in assessing how CNTs contribute to the properties of the composite. The results generally show marked improvement from the neat matrix, often depending on the amount of CNTs added and synthesize methods. Chitosan is a biocompatible, biodegradable, and nontoxic polysaccharide commonly derived from the shells of crab and other sea crustaceans and is very suitable for usage in the human body [2]. However, its mechanical properties often fail to meet up to the requirements under certain conditions. Although hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate cements, and clay are frequently used to reinforce the chitosan matrix, there are still very few studies on using CNTs to strengthen chitosan. Here we report a study on development of a method for synthesizing CNT/chitosan composite fiber and characterization of its mechanical properties.

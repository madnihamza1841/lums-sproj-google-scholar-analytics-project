Citations: 31
Authors:M.I.R. Khan, N.A. Khan
Publication_date: 2017
Publication: The increase in abiotic stress factors has become a major threat to the sustainability of crop production. This situation has led to thinking of ways which can help to come up with potential measures. It is, therefore, necessary to understand the influence of abiotic stress factors on crop performance and the mechanisms by which these factors impact plants. It has now become evident that abiotic stress impacts negatively on plant growth and development at every stage of the plant’s life. Plants adapt to the changing environment with the adjustment at physiological, biochemical and molecular levels. The primary possible mechanism involved in the negative effects of abiotic stress factors is the excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). They alter physiological and molecular mechanisms leading to poor performance of plants. Plants, however, are able to cope with these adverse effects by inducing antioxidant …

177. Ethylene: A Key Regulatory Molecule in Plants
Citations: 11
Authors:N.A. Khan, M.I.R. Khan, A. Ferrante, P. Peter
Publication_date: 2017
Publication: Ethylene is a simple gaseous phytohormone with multiple roles in regulation of metabolism at cellular, molecular, and whole plant level (Pierik et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2009; Schaller, 2012; Khan NA and Khan MIR, 2014). It influences performance of plants under optimal and stressful environments by interacting with other signaling molecules (Müller and Munné-Bosch, 2015; Thao et al., 2015). The action of ethylene depends on its concentration in cell and the sensitivity of plants to the hormone (Pierik et al., 2006; Habben et al., 2014; Arraes et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2016). In recent years, research on ethylene has been focused due to its dual action on the regulation of plant processes at physiological and molecular level. The aim of the current research topic was to explore and update our understanding on its regulatory role of ethylene in plant developmental mechanisms at cellular or whole plant level under optimal and changing environmental conditions. The present edited volume includes original research papers and reviews articles describing ethylene’s regulatory role in plant development during plant ontogeny and how it interacts with biotic and abiotic stress factors. For better understanding of the articles included in this volume, papers have been grouped into three categories.

Publication_date: Information about slaughter of pregnant animals was collected from reproductive tracts of 772 buffaloes, 325 cows, 2340 sheep and 2023 goats from a local abattoir. Each tract was examined for the presence of pregnancy, right and left side containing single, twins or triplets. The results showed that pregnancies were 11.65% in buffaloes, 8.61% in cows, 21.28% in sheep and 19.22% in goats. In buffaloes and cows, each pregnancy comprised of a single foetus. In buffaloes, the distribution of pregnancies was 51.11% on the right and 48.88% on left side whereas in cows, 57.14% on right and 42.85% on left side. These findings were not significantly different from those of Rind et al.(1) who recorded 60 and 58 per cent pregnancies on the right and 40 and 42 per cent on the left side in buffaloes respectively. In cows, Al-Dahash and Dvid (2) reported 61.54 per cent pregnancies on the right and 38.46 per cent on the left side which was also not significantly different from the present findings. Among 498 pregnancies recorded in sheep, the number of foetuses was 598. Of these, the right side pregnancies yielded 239 (48%) single, 47 (9.43%) twins and one (0.20%) triplet whereas the left side pregnancies yielded 160 (32.12%) single and 51 (10.24%) twins. In goats, a total 457 foetuses were recorded from 389 pregnancies. Of these, the right side pregnancies yielded 190 (48.84%) single and 38 (9.76%) twins whereas the left side pregnancies comprised of 131 (33.67%) single and 30 (7.71%) twins.

Publication_date: 2010
Publication: This study focuses on the training of community midwives (CMWs) in Pakistan, to specifically look at the institutions providing CMW training to see what resources (both physical and human resources) they had available and how these resources were being utilized. This study served as an early evaluation of the trainings and upgrades by the PAIMAN project, to assess how their interventions fared, and provides documentation for future decisions regarding the management, training, and practice of CMWs in Pakistan. As Pakistan transitions from a country with a high level of home births to a country where most births take place in institutional settings, trained CMWs can ease that transition, saving the lives of mothers and newborns as the transition unfolds. The report concludes that the MNCH needs to take more ownership of the program to better coordinate the training of tutors and clinical supervisors and to provide better supervision of the curriculum and trainings being imparted to the CMW trainees.

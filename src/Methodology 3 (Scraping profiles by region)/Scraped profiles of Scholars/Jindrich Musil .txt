Publication: Experimental details DC pulsed magnetron discharge was generated in two cylindrical deposition chambers with a diameter of 250 mm pumped down by i) turbo pump 1500 l/s and ii) oil diffusion pump 2000 l/s with water cooling to base pressures ptot= 5x10-5 Pa and ptot= 2x10-3 Pa, respectively. The round shape magnetron with Al (purity 99, 99) target of a diameter 100 mm was used for sputtering. DC magnetron voltage was changed in the interval from 100 to 600 V. A DC power supply Huettinger 3000 combined with pulse generator MELEC operated at the discharge voltage Ud= 500 V, power Pd= 400 W, the repetition frequency f= 10 kHz, pulse length τ= 50 μs and duty cycle τ/T= 0.5, were T is the period of pulses, were used for main part of experiments. The magnetron discharge was maintained at pressures ranging from 0.1 to 1 Pa, a main part of experiments was done at constant pressureof 0.5 Pa. Argon (purity 99.99) was used as a working gas, Ar flow QAr was kept constant at 16 sccm, and for oxidation processes oxygen gas of purity 99.999 was used, O2 flow was varied from 0 to 8 sccm. Al target was sputtered in Ar/O2 mixture at total pressure ranging from 0.2 to 1 Pa. Plasma properties in metallic, transition and oxide mode of sputtering were investigated. The plasma of DC pulsed magnetron discharge was investigated by means of mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometer (MS) EQP 500 HIDEN Analytical Ltd. with three orifices of diameters 0.8, 1.5 and 2 mm in the first, second and third stage of MS [6] was used in the device pumped by the turbo pump and MS equipped only one orifice of diameter 0.2 mm was used in the …

Publication_date: Methods
After IRB approval, 9 volunteers were enrolled in this study. Each volunteer was seated upright, was instructed to minimize head movement, and inhaled ambient air through a tightly sealed face mask that directed exhaled air to a capnograph (Datex-Ohmeda Capnomac Ultima). A blood pressure cuff was placed on the upper arm, and a pulse oximeter was placed on a finger. The optoacoustic probe was applied to the head. End-tidal CO 2 (EtCO 2), respiratory frequency, blood pressure (systolic/diastolic/mean), heart rate, arterial O 2 sat, and SSS O 2 sat were monitored throughout the experiment. After at least 5 minutes of baseline measurements, the subjects were asked to breathe deeply and adjust their respiratory frequency and depth (by watching the capnograph screen) to maintain an EtCO 2 of 20-25 mmHg. After at least 10 min. of hyperventilation, normal breathing was resumed and the monitoring continued until EtCO 2 returned to baseline.

Publication: The fact that people of all walks of life are becoming more and more reliant on a widerange of easily-available digital content is often called the Copy-Paste Syndrome. It implies the indiscriminate usage of material ie without checking for reliability or a concern for violations of intellectual property rights or plagiarism, a kind of cheating that has become uncomfortably widespread. A holistic approach is required to address this universal problem combining an institutional approach together with the application of viable technologies, rather than a-posteriory checks with software of doubtful reliability. This paper describes a learning ecosystem, ICARE, that addresses the Copy-Paste Syndrome by minimizing the possibility for unwanted copy-and-paste situations.

Authors:Hermann Maurer, Namik Delilovic, Bilal Zaka, Islamabad COMSATS
Publication_date: In this paper we argue that by using software that allows to add all kinds of interactions and media to digital books we can create what we will call interactive books (IBs for short). Collections of such books are attractive to use for many purposes of information communication, be it as guide-book, handbook, manual or instructional material like in e-Learning systems. Yet the systems developed are easier to maintain than complex environments: changes usually do not require any programming but just HTML-like editing.

28. Digital Game Based Learning in Business Management Education: A Step from Entertainment to Digital Literacy
Citations: 
Authors:Abida Ellahi, Fahd Sultan, Bilal Zaka
Publication_date: Recent years have seen an escalating interest in the use of digital games in pursuit of educational goals. The present research also examined the impact of using digital games on learning in higher education. Female participants (N= 46) from a women university in Pakistan were assigned to an experimental condition. The effect of game design with moderating effect of 3D dimension modelling, game contents and social context was examined on learning effectiveness. Results found significant impact of game design with moderating effect of 3D dimension modelling and game contents on learning satisfaction. However, results did not show a significant impact of collaboration on learning satisfaction during the experimental play session. Results are discussed in terms of the potential for higher education learning games and technology to increase students‚Äô perceived learning effectiveness. This study reinforces the use of digital games in higher education. It also emphasize the necessity of further research to evaluate the academic value of digital games in students‚Äô learning and knowledge retention.

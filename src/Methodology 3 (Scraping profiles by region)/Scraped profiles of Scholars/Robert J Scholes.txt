Publication_date: 2012
Publication: To bring our interconnected food and climate systems within a ‘safe operating space’ for people and the planet, the Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change has outlined seven major areas for policy action. Throughout 2011, the Commission worked to harvest the practical solutions detailed in the many recent authoritative reports on food security and climate change. By combining this thorough review of the substantive evidence base with the diverse perspectives and disciplinary expertise, the 13 Commissioners have crafted a succinct roadmap for policy makers. The Commission offers no ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution, but rather points the way forward to foster national, regional and sectoral innovation that can aggregate up to meaningful global change.

Publication: The South African Country Study on Climate Change, carried out in the late 1990’s, identified the Northern and Western Cape Provinces as being most at risk from projected climate change-induced warming and rainfall change (results of this study are summarized in South Africa’s initial National Communication, prepared in accordance with Article 12 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: www. environment. gov. za/Documents/Docume nts/2005Feb22/NatCom_Nov% 202003% 20 (b). doc).
However, this study was based on a limited set of model projections of climate change that have now been superseded by projections using more advanced techniques. In this study we have carried out a broad reassessment of the vulnerability of the Western Cape to climate change impacts, using a wider range of climate scenarios from more sophisticated climate models, and for a range of sectors (with the exception of agriculture and fisheries, according to our brief). We also identify some key adaptive strategies that might alleviate or avoid the worst impacts of climate change in some sectors. We conclude that further detailed study of some of the implications of these findings will be necessary to explore these and further strategies in order to guide policy development.

Publication_date: 2008/5/27
Publication: The principal mechanisms that connect carbon fluxes with water relations in savanna ecosystems were studied by using eddy covariance in a savanna ecosystem at Kruger National Park, South Africa. Since the annual drought and rewetting cycle is a major factor influencing the function of savanna ecosystems, this work focused on the close inter-connection between water relations and carbon fluxes. Data from a nine-month measuring campaign lasting from the early wet season to the late dry season were used. Total ecosystem respiration showed highest values at the onset of the growing season, a slightly lower plateau during the main part of the growing season and a continuous decrease during the transition towards the dry season. The regulation of canopy conductance was changed in two ways: changes due to phenology during the course of the growing season and short-term acclimation to soil water conditions. The most constant parameter was water use efficiency that was influenced by VPD during the day but the VPD response curve of water usage did change only slightly during the course of the growing season and decreased by about 30% during the transition from wet to dry season. The regulation of canopy conductance and photosynthetic capacity were closely related. This observation meets recent leaf-level findings that stomatal closure triggers down-regulation of Rubisco during drought. Our results may show the effects of these processes on the ecosystem scale.

Publication_date: 2006
Publication: Biodiversity offers multiple opportunities for development and improving human well-being. It is the basis for essential environmental services upon which life on Earth depends. Thus, its conservation and sustainable use are of critical importance. The opportunities and challenges associated with biodiversity typically apply over large geographical extents, although one or two issues may be more important at any given location. To avoid repetition, particular issues are highlighted in the sub-regional sections, not because opportunities and challenges are restricted to those areas, but because are best illustrated there. Deforestation is discussed under Central Africa, while relations between protected areas and adjacent populations are dealt with under Eastern Africa. Riparian biodiversity is discussed in Northern Africa, climate change and invasive alien species (IAS) in Southern Africa, desertification in Western Africa, and endemism in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) islands. Habitat degradation and resource overexploitation are discussed in this regional synthesis, because are overwhelmingly important as drivers of biodiversity loss throughout Africa.

257. Agriculture and climate change mitigation in the developing world
Citations: 11
Authors:Robert J Scholes, Cheryl A Palm, Jonathan E Hickman
Publication_date: 2014
Publication: Agricultural activities in the developing world directly contribute about 4.23 GtCO2eq/y to the current anthropogenic forcing of the global climate, and indirectly a further approximately 3.93GtCO2eq/y through forest clearing and degradation. Together they constitute a quarter of the total global climate forcing from all sources. Many proven agricultural practices and policies can reduce this impact on the global climate without compromising food production, or reduce the climate impact per unit of agricultural production. A reasonable target by 2030 for climate mitigation in developing world agriculture, taking into account the large difference between technical potentials and economically viable adoption rates and noting the equity issues relating to the mitigation activities in the developing world, is around 1.2 GtCO2eq/y for agriculture (~ 22% of projected unmitigated agricultural emissions by 2030) and 1.2 GtCO2eq/y for avoided and more climate-appropriate land use changes (~ 30% of current land use change related emissions).

Citations: 8
Authors:Christo Fabricius, RJ Scholes, Georgina Cundill
Publication_date: 2006
Publication: The Southern African Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (SAfMA, http://www.maweb.org) was undertaken at a variety of spatial scales, from the regional (with sub-Saharan Africa as the assessment area) to the local (at the scale of a village, single protected area, or micro watershed). Each of these scales had its own stakeholders and thus its own key topics of concern. These in turn defined the information needs for the assessment at that scale. The authors found that as the scale of assessment moved from regional to local, the balance of information availability shifted from formal, documented data, typically regarded as being in the “scientific domain,” toward informal, tacit information contained in the life experience of local residents and in folklore transmitted by oral tradition, or perhaps documented but not in accordance with conventional scientific standards. According to the authors the distinction between “formal” and “informal” knowledge is not as absolute as is often thought. They point out that both use broad principles, similar rules and validation, although the procedures may differ. Elements of both sorts of knowledge exist at all scales, although informal knowledge is generally more site specific and restricted by design and circumstances than scientific knowledge is.

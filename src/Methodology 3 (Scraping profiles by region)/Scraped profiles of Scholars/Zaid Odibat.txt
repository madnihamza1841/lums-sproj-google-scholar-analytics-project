Authors:Zaid M Odibat
Publication_date: The dynamics of fractional order systems have attracted a great deal of attentions in recent years. In this paper, we study the chaos synchronization of two identical fractional order systems with a suitable feedback controller applied to the response system. Based on the stability results of linear fractional order systems, sufficient conditions for chaos synchronization are derived. The numerical results show that fractional order chaotic systems can be synchronized.

105. APPLİCATİON OF MULTİ-STEP DİFFERENTİAL TRANSFORM METHOD FOR THE ANALYTİCAL AND NUMERİCAL SOLUTİONS OF THE DENSİTY DEPENDENT NAGUMO TELEGRAPH EQUATİON
Citations: 
Authors:VEDAT SUAT ERTÜRK, ZAİD M ODİBAT, SHAHER MOMANİ
Publication_date: The Differential Transform Method (DTM) is an analytical and numerical method for solving a wide variety of differential equations and usually gets the solution in a series form. The multi-step DTM is treated as an algorithm in a sequence of intervals for finding accurate approximate solutions. In this paper, this new algorithm is applied to a class of density dependent diffusion equations with memory-delay effect. The multistep differential transform solutions for various strengths of the density dependence along with bounds on the range of the convergence are obtained. The numerical solutions are obtained by the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 45 method. Then, a comparative study between the multi-step DTM and Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 45 method is presented. The results demonstrate reliability and efficiency of the algorithm developed. Finally, the dependence of the traveling wave solutions on various parameters, particularly the memory-delay term, is discussed.

Authors:Ahmad El-Ajou, Zaid Odibat, Ahmad Alawneh
Publication_date: This paper presents an efficient numerical algorithm for approximate solutions of population growth models. The algorithm is based on the homotopy analysis method (HAM). Particular attention is paid throughout this paper to outline the features of the method. The HAM provides us with a simple way to adjust and control the convergence region of the series solution by introducing the auxiliary parameters. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of solutions for three types of population growth models. The Pad approximants are effectively used in the analysis to capture the essential behavior of the population of the identical individuals.

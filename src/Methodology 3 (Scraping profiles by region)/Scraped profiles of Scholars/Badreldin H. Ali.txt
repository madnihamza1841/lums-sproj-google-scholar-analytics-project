The programme of studies is focused on equipping the students with both general pedagogical knowledge and specialist competencies. Institute of Pedagogy is also involved in teacher education.
Since the very beginning of its existence a lot of scientific projects have been realised by the Institute staff. The most important of them are: anthropological and axiological basis of education and formation, system of education, history of elementary education and social care, basis of" open pedagogy" and Christian pedagogy, research on family, personalistic pedagogy, pedagogical thought of the 1918 …

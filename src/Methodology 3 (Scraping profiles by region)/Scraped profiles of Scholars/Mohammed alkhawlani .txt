28. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF BFSK MULTI-HOP COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS OVER Κ-µ FADING CHANNEL USING GENERALIZED GAUSSIAN-FINITE-MIXTURE TECHNIQUE

Authors:Murad A AAlmekhlafi, Shafea M Al-yousofi, Mohammed M Alkhawlani
Publication_date: Multi-hop communication systems gained popularity in wireless communications; they can be used to extend the coverage of the network and reduce the transmitted power. The transmission of data from the source node to the destination node in multi-hop communications undergoes through intermediate relay nodes. In this paper, we study the performance of multi-hop communication systems, in terms of average bit error rate (BER) with Binary frequency shift keying assuming the κ-µ fading channel model. Due to the difficulty in finding the probability density function (PDF) of the end-to-end signal to noise ratio (SNR) and hence for the performance metrics, we use Gaussian Mixture (GM) approximation technique to approximate the PDF of the end to end SNR assuming the κ-µ fading models as weighted sums of Gaussian distributions. Numerical results are provided for the BER of binary frequency shift keying (BFSK) of amplify and forward (AF) multi-hop communication systems assuming different values for the fading parameters (,) and for different number of hops. Numerical results are validated by comparing them with simulation results.

Publication_date: 1996
Publication: Angiotensin converting enzymes inhibitors are now regarded as the cornerstone of congestive heart failure therapy owing to established reduction in mortality and the symptomatic amelioration following their use. Although the response to converting enzyme inhibitor therapy may be influenced by race, we have reported a trend to reduce intra hospital mortality, the correction of hyponatremia and shortened hospitalization in Nigerians treated with converting enzyme inhibitors. We have now conducted an extended retrospective study, to evaluate the trends in the use of enalapril or captopril and its impact on prognosis in Nigerian patients with heart failure alone, admitted between January 1992 to December 1994. The proportion of heart failure treated with (captopril or enalapril) increased from 37pc in 1992, to 50pc in 1993, to 65pc in 1994. The demographic variables and cause of heart disease were similar in patients treated with converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 55) and those treated conventionally (n = 36). The cumulative mortality among converting enzyme inhibitors treated patients, was (8/55, 14pc) compared to patients not treated (17/36, 48pc) x2 = 12.4; p < 0.0001. There was no sex predilection in mortality (M = 25pc, F = 28pc, mean 27pc). However, initial serum Na+,125mmol was significantly (x2 = 11.1; p < 0.001) more common in the dead patients, 25pc compared to the survivors discharged home 7.5pc. The median hospital stay was 17 days in captopril treated survivors (range two to 44 days) and 19 days (range four to 67 days) in conventionally treated patients. Thus converting enzyme inhibitor therapy may reduce intra hospital …

Publication: The Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) programme in the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan has been in existence for more than five years and has scaled up to other sites. The study evaluated the service uptake and performance of the programme using national key indicators. Antenatal and delivery records of women enrolled between July 2002 and June 2007 were reviewed. A total of 51952 women attended first antenatal visits and received HIV pre-test counselling. Of these, 51614 (99.5%) accepted HIV test and 49134 (95.2%) returned for their results. Out of the tested patients, 2152 (4.2%) were identified to be HIV positive. Partners of positive patients accepting HIV testing were 361 (16.7%) with 87 (18.6%) testing positive. There were a total of 942 deliveries out of which 39.2% of the mothers and 95.2% of the babies respectively received ARV prophylaxis. In all, 85.8% (788/918) of the mothers opted for formula as the method of infant feeding. Out of the 303 babies eligible for ELISA testing, 68.3% reported for the test and 17 (8.7%) tested positive. There has been progress in the programme, reflected in the increase in the number of new clients accessing the PMTCT service. However, partner testing and follow up of mother-infant pairs remain formidable challenges that deserve special attention.

Publication: Objective:
The aim of this study was to assess long-term effects for women following the use of magnesium sulphate for pre-eclampsia.
Design:
Assessment at 2-3 years after delivery for women recruited to the Magpie Trial (recruitment in 1998-2001, ISRCTN 86938761), which compared magnesium sulphate with placebo for pre-eclampsia.
Setting:
Follow up after discharge from hospital at 125 centres in 19 countries across five continents.
Population:
A total of 7927 women were randomised at the follow-up centres. Of these women, 2544 were not included for logistic reasons and 601 excluded (109 at a centre where <20% of women were contacted, 466 discharged without a surviving child and 26 opted out). Therefore, 4782 women were selected for follow-up, of whom 3375 (71%) were traced.
Methods:
Questionnaire assessment was administered largely by post or in a dedicated clinic. Interview assessment of selected women was performed.
Main outcome measures:
Death or serious morbidity potentially related to pre-eclampsia at follow up, other morbidity and use of health service resources.
Results:
Median time from delivery to follow up was 26 months (interquartile range 19-36). Fifty-eight of 1650 (3.5%) women allocated magnesium sulphate died or had serious morbidity potentially related to pre-eclampsia compared with 72 of 1725 (4.2%) women allocated placebo (relative risk 0.84, 95% CI 0.60-1.18).
Conclusions:
The reduction in the risk of eclampsia following prophylaxis with magnesium sulphate was not associated with an excess of death or disability for the women after 2 years. © RCOG 2006 BJOG An International Journal of …

1 lntroduction: unsafe abortion as a development issue Unsafe abortion is one of the most pressing issues affecting humanity today (bouzahr 1994; Gomperts 2002) UUorlduide, it kills about 80.000 uuomen every year and this figure only represents the tip of the iceberg, since an estimated 25 times that number of uuomen suffer various ill-health effects as a result of unsafe procedures (Ciment 1999, Ahman and Shah 2002) ln Nigeria, uhere abortion is legal only to save the life of a uuoman, restrictive legislation and pervasive stigma conspire to drive abortion underground. The vast majority of the estimated 760.000 abortions that occur every year in Nigeria are clandestine (Bankole et al 2006), and the majority of these fatalities go unreported. There is no doubt that the primary casualties of unsafe procedures are poor uuomen (Braam and Hessini 2004), and …

Publication_date: 2005
Publication: Male role and responsibility in reproductive health matters become consistent prerequisites to understanding maternal issues generally. Through focus group discussions (FGDs}; this exploratory research investigates sexual behaviour of married men during pregnancy and afterbirth in Ibadan Southwestern Nigeria as a way of highlighting the links between these periods and pregnancy outcomes and the health status of couples. The study shows that sexual behaviour of men is influenced by the interplay of religious, socio-cultural and ideological factors. The specific results include that: men engage in coitus with their pregnant wives with the upper limit of 4 months among the Hausa;: postpartum sexual abstinence varies in duration with an average of 40 days across cultural settings; one sixth of the respondents agreed engaging in sexual intercourse with other women in order to- reduce their wives' vulnerability to the risks associated with pregnancy; and while men often use condom to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) from women other than their wives, most married men with established or presumed cases of STIs appear to be relatively casual and undiplomatic in handling this issue. These findings suggest that programmes targeted at husbands and their reproductive health orientation appear necessary to reduce the frequency of STIs and other negative reproductive health outcomes among couples.

Publication_date: Child adoption that may serve as an alternative treatment option for infertility for the affected couples is yet to be fully explored and integrated into management schedules. This was a crosssectional interviewer administered questionnaire survey involving 602 consenting men and women within Ibadan metropolis, South-Western Nigeria from May to July 2008. There is a general consensus on what child adoption is among the 96.7% of the participants who were aware of child adoption. However, only 33.1% of the participants believe child adoption is a treatment option for infertility and 44.2% will consider adopting if found in such situation. In conclusion, this study shows high level of awareness of child adoption in the community but fewer people see it as a treatment option for infertility. Measures like advocacy, community mobilization and enactment of supportive law will help in promoting its acceptability.

Publication: PURPOSE: Multidisciplinary tumor boards (MDTBs) are universally recommended, but recent literature has challenged their efficiency.
METHODS: The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conducted a survey of a randomly selected cohort of international ASCO members. The survey was built on SurveyMonkey and was sent via e-mail to a sample of 5,357 members.
RESULTS: In all, 501 ASCO members practicing outside the United States responded, and 86% of them participated in MDTBs at their own institutions. Those who attended represented a variety of disciplines in 70% to 86% of all MDTBs. The majority of MDTBs held weekly specialty and/or general meetings. Eighty-nine percent of 409 respondents attended for advice on treatment decisions. Survey respondents reported changes of 1% to 25% in treatment plans for 44% to 49% of patients with breast cancer and in 47% to 50% of patients with …

Publication_date: 2014
Publication: Corporal Punishment (CP) is one of the ways of disciplining students when they misbehave in many Nigerian schools. However, its application could lead to adverse physical consequences in students. In Nigeria, there are few documented studies relating to the perception and attitude of parents, teachers and students concerning CP in Secondary Schools (SS). This study was aimed therefore at assessing perception and attitude of parents, teachers and students towards CP in SS within Ibadan North-East Local Government Area (IBNELGA). This cross-sectional survey with a 3-stage sampling technique was used to select IBNELGA, eleven public and eight private SS and 344 teachers. A similar 3-stage sampling was also used to select IBNELGA, six wards and 215 consenting parents. Ten Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) (two each in public and private different SS among consenting teachers, three each among consenting public and private SS students) were conducted. Quantitative data were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire for teachers and parents respectively. The instrument included a 22-point perception and an 18-point attitudinal scales developed from WHO and UNICEF standards on CP with a score of <11 as wrong and >11 as right perception while a score of <9 as positive and >9 as negative attitude. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic approach while descriptive statistics, Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to analyse the quantitative data at 5% level of significance. Mean ages of teachers and parents were 38.1+8.1 and 40.6+7.2 years respectively. Mean years of service was 11.0+7.2 for …

Publication: Aims: This study aimed to describe the prevalence and pattern of lipid abnormalities among antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive HIV patients, understand if there is any relationship to virologic and immunologic status, and discuss the implications for care. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in which baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of all ART-naive HIV-infected individuals recruited into the adult ARV clinic, University College Hospital, Ibadan, between January and December 2006, were analyzed. Results: In total, 1316 ART-naive HIV-infected persons were recruited in the period. Females subjects and participants aged 35 years accounted for 67.1% and 57.7% of all participants, respectively. At least 1 abnormal lipid fraction was seen in 73.3% of participants. It was observed that in 11.5% participants the total cholesterol (TC) was 5.2 mmol/L, in 2.7% the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL)-C was> 4.1 mmol/L in 56.5% the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL)-C was< 1.0 mmol/L, and in 27.6% the triglyceride (TG) was> 1.7 mmol/L. The TC, LDL-C, and HDL-C were all significantly positively correlated with CD4 counts and negatively correlated with viral load. On the contrary, the TG levels were negatively correlated with CD4 counts and positively correlated with viral load. Multivariate linear analysis showed a significant relationship between all the lipid parameters and viral load. CD4 counts were only significantly associated with TC. Conclusions: A significant burden of dyslipidemia exists among ART-naive HIV-infected persons. Low HDL-C was the most frequently observed abnormality. The abnormalities …

Publication_date: 2011
Publication: Introduction:
Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in pregnancy with adverse pregnancy outcome has been well documented with Escherichia coli and other gram-negative rods being the common organism associated. However, most of these studies were done in patients without additional immunosuppressant except for pregnancy. However; the additional risk of HIV infection in pregnant woman necessitates the evaluation of the microbial isolates and antibiotic sensitivity pattern from the urine samples of these patients without any symptom.
Methods:
A prospective cohort study was undertaken among HIV positive pregnant women attending our Antiretroviral clinic between 1st May and 30th September 2007. Information recorded from the patient questionnaire included age, parity, marital status, occupation, and level of education. Culture and antibiotic sensitivity was carried out on aseptically collected urines from the patients.
Results:
Twenty-five. (15.5%) of the 161 urine samples cultured significantly grew organisms. Four of the urine specimen had, in addition, Candida isolated. The mean age of participants was 30.6 ± 4.3 years .and the modal parity was 2. The mean gestational age at presentation was 27.3± 3.2 weeks. Escherichia coli was isolated in 48%, Proteus in 16:0%, Klebsiella in 8.0%, and Staphylococcus aureus in 28.0%. The antibiotic sensitivity test showed that the organisms were 100% sensitive to ciprofloxacin, 80% sensitive to cefuroxime, 60% sensitive to ofloxacin and augmentin but only 36%, 20%, 8.0% and 4.6% sensitive to co-trimoxazole, amoxycillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, nitrofurantoin and gentamycin, respectively …

Publication: "INTRODUCTION:The clinical and public health implications of the convergence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic and chronic viral hepatitis in sub-Saharan Africa are poorly understood. This study was designed to determine the seroprevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), and the impact of co-infection on baseline serum alanine transaminase (ALT), CD4+ T lymphocyte (CD4) count, and plasma HIV-RNA (viral load) in a cohort of HIV-infected Nigerians. METHODS:A retrospective study was conducted, on eligible treatment-naive patients who presented between August 2004 and February 2007 to the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, Nigeria. Demographic data and pre-treatment laboratory results (hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HCV antibodies (anti-HCV), ALT, CD4 count and viral load) were retrieved from the medical records. Fisher's exact, two sample t-tests, and the Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare groups. A logistic regression model was fitted to explore characteristics associated with co-infection status. RESULTS:A total of 1779 HIV-infected patients (male: female ratio, 1:2) met inclusion criteria. HBsAg was present in 11.9%, anti-HCV in 4.8% and both markers in 1%. HBsAg was more common among males than females (15.4% vs 10.1%, respectively p = 0.001) while anti-HCV was detected in a similar proportion of males and females (5.3% versus 4.6%, respectively p = 0.559). HIV-infected patients with anti-HCV alone had a lower mean baseline CD4 count compared to those without anti-HCV or HBsAg (197 cells/mm3 vs 247 cells/mm3, respectively p = 0.008 …

Publication: Introduction:
Nigeria’s University College Hospital’s PMTCT centre provides voluntary counselling and testing as part of routine care which was assessed in this paper.
Methods:
Structured face-to-face interview was carried out at exit on participants from the counselling session. Data analysis was by frequency distribution.
Results:
All clients were assured of confidentiality, had their HIV/ AIDS knowledge assessed and consent taken before the test, 95.45% of participants had the possible outcomes of the test explained including coping ability and 13.64% did not have behaviour assessed for risk taking. Only 45.45% mentioned mother-to-child transmission as a major mode of transmission.
Conclusion:
Discussion of serostatus results in a safe setting and negotiating a risk -reduction plan are strategies that should be considered in all PMTCT services.

263. Community attitudes towards childbearing and abortion among HIV-positive women in Nigeria and Zambia
Citations: 
Authors:Isaac Adewole, Dzekedzeke Kumbutso
Publication_date: Although stigma towards HIV-positive women for both continuing and terminating a pregnancy has been documented, to date few studies have examined relative stigma towards one outcome versus the other. This study seeks to describe community attitudes towards each of two possible elective outcomes of an HIV-positive woman’s pregnancy–induced abortion or birth–to determine which garners more stigma and document characteristics of community members associated with stigmatising attitudes towards each outcome. Data come from community-based interviews with reproductive-aged men and women, 2401 in Zambia and 2452 in Nigeria. Bivariate and multivariate analyses revealed that respondents from both countries overwhelmingly favoured continued childbearing for HIV-positive pregnant women, but support for induced abortion was slightly higher in scenarios in which anti-retroviral therapy (ART) was unavailable. Zambian respondents held more stigmatising attitudes towards abortion for HIV-positive women than did Nigerian respondents. Women held more stigmatising attitudes towards abortion for HIV-positive women than men, particularly in Zambia. From a sexual and reproductive health and rights perspective, efforts to assist HIV-positive women in preventing unintended pregnancy and to support them in their pregnancy decisions when they do become pregnant should be encouraged in order to combat the social stigma documented in this paper.

264. 2Q1 Insights from an expert group meeting on the definition and 3 measurement of unsafe abortion
Citations: 
Authors:Janie Benson, Clementine Rossier, Andrea B Pembe, Isaac Adewole, Bela Ganatra, Sandra MacDonagh
Publication_date: 26 Until recently, WHO operationally defined unsafe abortion as illegal abortion. In the past decade, however, the 27 incidence of abortion by misoprostol administration has increased in countries with restrictive abortion laws. 28 Access to safe surgical abortions has also increased in many such countries. An important effect of these trends 29 has been that, even in an illegal environment, abortion is becoming safer, and an updated system for classifying 30 abortion in accordance with safety is needed. Numerous factors aside from abortion method or legality should be 31 taken into consideration in developing such a classification system. An Expert Meeting on the Definition and 32 Measurement of Unsafe Abortion was convened in London, UK, on January 9–10, 2014, to move toward develop-33 ing a classification system that both reflects current conditions and acknowledges the gradient of risk associated 34 with abortion. The experts also discussed the types of research needed to monitor the incidence of abortion at 35 each level of safety. These efforts are urgently needed if we are to ensure that preventing unsafe abortion is ap-36 propriately represented on the global public health agenda. Such a classification system would also motivate in-37 vestment in research to accurately measure and monitor abortion incidence across categories of safety. 38© 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. on behalf of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

Authors:DO Irabor, AE Irabor, IF Adewole, OO Afuwape
Publication_date: Objective: This study shows the proportion of patients with HIVAIDS at the PEPFAR clinic of the University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan who require surgical attention for conditions which may or may not be AIDS-related. Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive retrospective study utilizing the records of 8,285 patients who received treatment for HIVAIDS at the PEPFAR clinic, UCH Ibadan from August 2004 to January 2008, a period of 41 months. Results: Surgical referrals for 83 patients were retrieved; roughly 1% of the total of patients with HIVAIDS seen during the study period. Malignancies accounted for 51.8% of total, of which Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) accounted for majority (76.7%) followed by non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)(16.3%). Benign conditions like hernias (18%), anal conditions (7.2%) and abscesses (22.9%), accounted for the rest.
Conclusions: The small proportion of HIVAIDS patients requiring surgical attention suggests that the surgical services are in no danger of being overwhelmed. Also with the advent of HAART it is likely that the majority of malignant cases such as KS and NHL will decrease further relieving the surgical load. Anal disorders were surprisingly few in this study, however sociocultural apprehensions may be at play here regarding the fear of impotence after anal surgery.

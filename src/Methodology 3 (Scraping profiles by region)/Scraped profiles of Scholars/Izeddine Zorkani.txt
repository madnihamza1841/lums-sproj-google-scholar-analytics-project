Publication_date: 2015/6/4
Publication: The vanadium dioxide VO? currently became very motivating for the nanotechnologies’ researchers. It makes party of the intelligent materials because these optical properties abruptly change semiconductor state with metal at a critical temperature?= 68 C. This transition from reversible phase is carried out from a monoclinical structure characterizing its semiconductor state at low temperature towards the metal state of this material which becomes tétragonal rutile for?> 68????; it is done during a few nanoseconds. Several studies were made on this material in a massive state and a thin layer. We will simulate by Maple the constant optics of a thin layer of VO? thickness z= 82 nm for the metal state according to the energy? of the incidental photons in the energy interval: 0.001242??(ev)? 6, from the infra-red (IR) to the ultra-violet (UV) so as to be able to control the various technological nano applications, like the …

Publication: Most recently, Vanadium oxide nanoparticles/reduced Graphene oxide (VO-NPs/rGO) nanocomposite have attracted extensive attention due to their potential applications in energy-related areas. Hence, understanding the interactions on behalf the effect of graphene layers on the modification of VO-NPs properties as well as their growth mechanism are of great importance. In this work, our results are revealing that VO-NPs were efficiently grown and coated on the graphene surface and are clearly showing the strong effect of rGO layers on the growth of VO-NPs which leads to a modification in the form, the shape and also the phase. These interactions which were studied based on structural and morphological investigations will play an important role on the modification of these nanocomposites properties which is suitable for a wide range of potential applications and particularly as electrode in Li-ion batteries.

Publication: The ab-plane reflectivity of YBa {sub 2} Cu {sub 3} O {sub 6+ x} thin films was measured in the 500-25,000 cm {sup-1} range in samples with x= 1 (T {sub c}= 90 K), x= 0.85 (T {sub c}= 82 K), x= 0.6 (T {sub c}= 55 K), x= 0.45 (T {sub c}= 35 K) and x= 0.38 (T {sub c}= 20 K) in normal state. The effective charge carrier number obtained from the spectral weight increases with increasing x. Variation is consistent with higher d {sub c} resistivity for x< 0.45. On the other hand the scattering frequency dependent rate shows significant differences between optimally oxygen doped and underdoped material. Results show that the high-T {sub c} superconductor normal state deviates in many fundamental aspects from conventional superconductors.

Publication_date: 2002/3
Publication: Ion implantation of potassium has been demonstrated as a valuable new tool to improve the enhancement of the photoelectric emission of pure metal of tungsten in the aim to perform the photocathode electron emission rate. The investigation by density functional theory in the frame work of LSD performed by nolocal density approximation using the functional PW91, allows us to understand and explain the lowering of the work function under 4, 5 eV. The results of binding energy calculations are presented to elucidate the prediction of geometry optimization of K/W clusters. K valence electrons originating from the atomic 4s states are polarized toward the W surface leading to an increase of electronic charge in the K/W interface region. The K-induced changes in the charge density are essentially localized outside the surface W atoms. In addition the semi-core K (3p) electrons are markedly counter polarized. The net results of these multiple dipoles is a lowering of the work function upon K atoms adsorbed on W Surface improving the enhancement of the electron emission rate of the surface elaborated.

Publication: L'objet de ce travail, est de proposer un modèle théorique pour calculer le coefficient d'absorption, pour un fil quantique de section carré, par la méthode variationnelle, en tenant compte de l'interaction du porteur de charge avec les LO-phonons, et en présence d’un champ magnétique extérieur. Nous avons considéré une transition entre l'état fondamental de l’impureté et le premier état de la subbande. Le confinement a été décrit par un puits de potentiel infini, et le couplage porteurs de charges-phonons a été traité dans l’approximation adiabatique. Nous avons choisi pour nos calculs comme exemple un fil quantique de GaAs entouré de GaAlAs. Et nos résultats seront comparés à d’autres travaux théoriques et expérimentaux.

Citations: 
Authors:F El Kadi, A Jorio, I Zorkani, A Chahboun
Publication_date: InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QD’s) have demonstrated their potential for future applications in low threshold lasers emitting at 1.3-1.5 µm wavelength suitable for optical fibers [1]. In most QD’s applications, the devices are supposed to work at room temperature or even higher. However, the luminescence is often quenched at temperatures lower than 300K, due to the carrier’s escape from the QD [2-4]. In order to improve the emission performance, it is important to investigate the factors influencing the temperature dependence of the emission. In this work, we have used the photoluminescence (PL) technique to characterize InAs/GaAs QDs dots size dispersion, and the thermal behavior of the emitted light. A homogenous size and composition dispersion was observed, which demonstrates the high quality of the samples investigated. The evolution of PL with temperature indicates that the carriers escape thermally from …

Publication: An integrated steady state heat and power distribution analysis tool was developed. The distribution system was represented as a set of interacting network and generation plant modules. System operation was determined on a minimum cost basis at each time step. The model was used to compare the performance of two community generation options integrating biomass with natural gas CHP for a case study based on a proposed new build development in the UK.

Publication: Heat loss in pipes and pump electrical energy consumption are unavoidable during the operation of a district heating (DH) system. In order to reduce total operating costs and improve energy efficiency appropriate operating strategy should be chosen. This study is aimed at optimising the supply water temperature and mass flow rate in a DH system, depending on the heating load variations. The minimisation of operating costs of DH system with different heat sources was conducted. Two different design cases of a DH pipe network based upon of a real project redevelopment in Wales, UK, were considered. First, the DH pipe network was designed based on a low pressure loss (100 Pa/m). It means that pipes with large diameters and small size pump were chosen. Second, the DH pipe network was re-designed using a larger pressure drop (1200 Pa/m). In this case smaller diameter pipes and larger size pump were selected. An optimisation model was developed using FICOTM Xpress optimisation tool. Hydraulic and thermal calculations were validated using commercial software PSS SINCAL. Three cases with different heat sources connected to the DH network were investigated. In the first case it was assumed that the fuel cost was negligible. In the second case, water boiler was used. In the third case combined heat and power (CHP) connected to the DH network was considered. The optimisation of annual supply water temperature and mass flow rate was achieved by minimising annual operating costs. Heat loss and pump energy consumption were calculated. Results show that optimum flow and supply temperature profile over the year …

Publication: Wind turbine capability for provision of electrical power system support is investigated. Predicted increased penetration levels of wind power in Europe and worldwide mean that compliance of wind farms to grid code regulations and incorporation of ancillary services previously only supplied by large generating units is becoming the norm. A review of transmission grid connection codes for the UK (NGrid), Ireland (EIRGrid), Germany (EOn) and Denmark (Eltra) is included along with a review of published work on Doubly Fed Induction Generators (DFIG) and Full Power Converter (FPC) wind turbine control methods; these two wind turbine topologies making up the largest proportion of new and planned installations. Finally provision and operation of system frequency services towards the year 2020 is considered for different generation penetration scenarios.
All of the grid codes specify basic operating requirements …

Publication_date: Due to high PV penetration, voltage violations are one of the major problems which occur in networks. Existing conventional voltage-var control techniques in such networks consider the voltages at their connection points, for maintaining the voltage profile within the limit. Though useful, this method is not an efficient method for voltage control in the network with rooftop PV panels which have voltage fluctuations throughout the feeder. The centralized reactive power control method is introduced in order to improve the effectiveness of the method. This paper addresses a technique for minimizing the voltage violations in the feeder by utilizing the unused capacity of PV inverters. The method is validated in three different type networks selected from a Sri Lankan distribution network. The obtained results demonstrate that this technique is able to reduce the voltage violations in the network.

Publication_date: Electrical panel boards are used to locate controlling, measuring and metering devices which are used in electrical power distribution. It is a customized product which is used for a specific purpose. In order to obtain the proper functioning of an electrical panel board, it should be maintained properly. Normally it will be a routine maintenance which will be performed once a year or half a year. But it is very important to know the service condition of an electrical panel board to avoid failures and perform the maintenance activity where it is necessary. This research presents a method to assess the service condition of an electrical panel board. Initially the importance of the temperature, the humidity and number of operations of a circuit breaker is highlighted. This was proven by various field measurements. Those measurements were statistically analysed and the Service Condition Analyser (SCA) was fabricated and tested under the laboratory conditions.

Authors:John Licari, Janaka Ekanayake, Ian Moore
Publication_date: With a high penetration of wind turbines, the proportion of synchronous generation in the power system will be reduced at times, thus creating operating difficulties especially during frequency events. Therefore, it is anticipated that many grid operators will demand inertia response from wind turbines. In this article, different ways for emulating inertia response in full-rated power converter-based wind turbines equipped with permanent magnet synchronous generators are considered. Supplementary control signals are added to the controller of the wind turbine to extract stored energy from the rotating mass and DC-link capacitors. Simulations in MATLAB/Simulink show that the inertia response is improved by adding a term proportional to the rate of change of frequency and by extracting the stored energy in the DC-link capacitors.

255. Fault ride through performance of a wide speed range wind turbine with AC and DC transmission systems
Citations: 
Authors:G Ramtharan, A Arulampalam, JB Ekanayake, FM Hughes, N Jenkins
Publication_date: Wind turbines using fully rated converters are emerging as one of the more popular variable speed wind turbine architectures [1]. Decoupled operation of the wind turbine generator and the grid side converter facilitates the implementation of effective controllers [2]. This topology has several advantages such as (i) wide speed range of operation,(ii) direct control of real and reactive power to the grid,(iii) reduced mechanical stress and (iv) during a fault, full control over the generator and the grid side converter for network support.
Large wind farms are usually connected through High Voltage AC transmission (HVAC)[3]. Due to capacity and distance limitations of HVAC, Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based High Voltage DC (HVDC) is an alternative option for large offshore wind farms [2][4]. Most Grid Codes now require wind turbines to remain connected to the grid during a network fault for a certain period of time. In order to assist voltage recovery of an AC network during a fault, the GB Grid Code encourages the wind farms to increase its reactive power supply to the AC network without exceeding its current limit [5]. The E. ON Grid Code defines the required reactive current against voltage dip magnitude [6]. When an offshore wind farm is connected through HVDC, the offshore AC network and the onshore AC network are decoupled from each other [7][8]. Therefore, the HVDC link provides a number of facilities that can help to achieve Grid Code compliance [9].

Publication_date: This paper summarises uses for smart meter data in the context of electricity distribution networks. Potential use cases are divided into those applicable to network planning and those applicable to network operation. Further sections discuss energy use reduction, frequency response and the impact of more widespread demand response schemes.
The UK smart metering implementation proposals are discussed and an overview of individual smart meter operation is given. It was observed that the requirement for smart meters to detect frequency and total harmonic distortion has been removed from the UK proposals. Also, since it was noted that the smart meter firmware and external communication hardware are set to be upgradable, it was postulated that smart meter hardware constraints, such as sampling rate, sampling resolution, processor, memory and architecture, will be a limiting factor in the functionality of the smart metering system seen by the network operators.

259. Electricity Generation from Wind Energy
Citations: 
Authors:Janaka Ekanayake, Phill Cartwright, Mike Hughes
Publication_date: There is now general acceptance that the burning of fossil fuels is having a significant influence on the global climate. Effective mitigation of climate change will require deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, with UK estimates of a 60–80% cut being necessary by 2050 (Stern Review, UK HM Treasury, 2006). The electricity system is viewed as being easier to transfer to low-carbon energy sources than more challenging sectors of the economy such as surface and air transport and domestic heating. Hence the use of cost-effective and reliable low-carbon electricity generation sources, in addition to demand-side measures, is becoming an important objective of energy policy in many countries (EWEA, 2006; AWEA, 2007). Over the past few years, wind energy has shown the fastest rate of growth of any form of electricity generation with its development stimulated by concerns of national policy makers over climate change, energy diversity and security of supply.

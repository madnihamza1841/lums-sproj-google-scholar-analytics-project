Publication: The increasing burden of chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney failure presents a challenge for both developed and emerging countries. While dialysis and transplantation consumes an ever-increasing proportion of the health budget in countries such as the United States, Japan and Taiwan, there is limited availability of these expensive therapies in the majority of emerging countries and more so in African nations. Aims: To review the prevalence, causes and integrated strategies for treatment and prevention of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Materials and Methods: Review of literature and information received from colleagues in Africa.
Results: Approximately 70% of the least developed countries of the world are in SSA. Rapid urbanisation is occurring in many parts of the continent, contributing to overcrowding and poverty. While infections and parasitic diseases are still the …

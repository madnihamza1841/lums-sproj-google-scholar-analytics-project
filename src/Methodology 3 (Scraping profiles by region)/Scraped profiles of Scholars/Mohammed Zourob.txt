Publication: Disease prevention has a huge impact on human life, and effective pathogen detection is the key element in the treatment of infectious diseases. One of the major ways of transmitting pathogens into the human body is the existence of bacteria in food. Acute foodborne infections and intoxications are much more of a concern to the food industry today. To improve food quality and safety, it is important to identify, detect, and trace food and water pathogens and their toxins (Tlili et al., 2013). According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC, 2010) in the United States, every year $1 in 6 Americans (or 48 million people) becomes ill, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3000 die from foodborne diseases. A robust, portable sampling device for pathogen detection will have significant value in food and environmental quality control. Micro total analysis systems (μTAS) have an important role producing small, fast, easy-to-use, portable platforms for pathogen detection in food samples. Microfluidic technology has revolutionized pathogen detection by providing straightforward analysis of samples in a short-time manner. The object of this chapter is to investigate the application of microfluidics in pathogen detection in food samples. In this chapter, we first outline the common foodborne pathogens in food samples and problems associated with the existence of bacteria in those samples. Later, various protein-based (immunoassay) and genomic-based pathogen detection mechanisms will be discussed. Finally, several robust microfluidic platforms for bacteria detection are presented.

We present possible sensing techniques that are already implemented for environmental applications. Finally, several most prominent high-sensitivity lab-ona-chip (LOC) platforms for detection/quantification of pathogens in water and wastewater samples are demonstrated.

Publication: An integrated, sensitive and rapid system was developed for the detection of bacteria. The system combined an optical metal-clad leaky waveguide MCLW sensor with an electric field. The electric field was used to concentrate Bacillus subtilis var. nigerBG bacteria spores onto the immobilized anti-BG antibody on the MCLW sensor surface. This sensor combination has been characterised by detecting the scattering from bacterial spores, which are concentrated at the sensor surface, when they are illuminated at the coupling angle; and by detection of fluorescence from labelled antibodies added after the spores had been captured on the surface. The light scattering and fluorescence detection methods gave a detection limit of BG bacterial spores of 1 103 spores ml1 when the electric field was applied for 3 minutes.

Publication_date: Effective pathogen detection is necessary for treatment of infectious disease. Point of care (POC) devices have tremendously improved the global human heath. However, design criteria for sample processing POC devices for pathogen detection in limited infrastructure are challenging and can make significant contribution in global health by providing rapid and sensitive detection of bacteria in food, water, and 10 patient’s sample. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel portable POC diagnostic device that is simple to assemble for genetic detection of bacterial pathogens by isothermal DNA amplification. The device is fabricated with very low production costs, using simple methods and easy-to-access materials on flexible ribbon polyethylene substrate. We showed that the device is capable of detection of 30 CFU/ml of E. coli and 200 CFU/ml of S. aureus in less than 1 hour. Through numerical simulations, we estimated that the 15 device can be extended to high-throughput detection simultaneously performing a minimum of 36 analyses. This robust and sensitive detection device can be assembled and operated by non-specialist personnel, particularly for multiple bacterial pathogen detections in low-resource settings.

Publication_date: Microarrays are spatially ordered arrays with ligands chemically immobilized in discrete spots on a solid matrix, usually a microscope slide. Microarrays are a high-throughput large-scale screening system enabling simultaneous identification of a large number of target molecules (up to several hundred thousand) that bind specifically to the immobilized ligands of the array. Microarrays represent a promising tool for clinical, environmental, and industrial microbiology since the technology allows relatively rapid screening and identification of large number of specific analytes or genetic determinants simultaneously. The successful use of microarrays requires attention to unique issues of experimental design and execution. This book provides an overview of the methodology and applications of biological microarrays in various areas of biological and biomedical research. This book presents a significant and up-to-date …

Publication_date: Prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in male, aside from lung cancer. Prostate cancer is commonly treated by radical prostatectomy. However, fifteen years following prostactomy, recurrence was possible in approximately 40% of patients. Proteolytically-active prostate specific antigen (PSA) level perturbation was found to be useful tool for detecting biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy. Current diagnostic methods do not discriminate between proteotically-active and inactive PSA forms. Thus, a paper-based biosensor for the evaluation of active PSA level was constructed. The biosensing configuration is based on the detection of PSA amylodic activity using a specific peptide substrate, sandwiched between magnetic nanonanoparticles and gold sensing platform placed on the top of a paper support. Upon PSA introduction, an external magnet fixed at the back of the sensor sopport would accelerate the cleavage of the magnetic nanoparticles-peptide moieties away from the surface. The colour change resulting from this dissociation was detected by the naked eye. This biosensor was amenable for a qualitative and quantitative PSA detection in buffer and in spiked urine samples with a lower detection limit of 1 ng/mL and 5 ng/mL, respectively. In conclusion, the designed colorimetric biosensor pinpointed superiority in criteria's including sensitivity; simplicity and fast processing time.

168. PATHOGENIC PARTICLE DETECTION USING DISPOSABLE LEAKY WAVEGUIDE OPTICAL SENSORS
Citations: 
Authors:Mohammed Zourob, Stephan Mohr, Nicholas J Goddard
Publication_date: Novel disposable absorbing materials clad Leaky Waveguide sensor Devices (LWD) have been developed for the detection of pathogenic particles such as bacteria. These chips are tailored to give the maximum extension of the evanescent field into the channel to place the bulk volume of the bacteria within the evanescent field. The scattering and fluorescence intensity of the bacteria using these chips is 3 times greater than with SPR. Disposable LWD chips were fabricated at room temperat-ure and without the use of expensive fabrication equipment. These LWDs have been characterised by detecting the fluorescence and scattering from bacterial spores at the sensor surface when illuminated at the coupling angle.

Publication_date: Nanowires are excellent bio-sensing components in terms of increased sensitivity and low reagents consumption. Nanowire biosensing platforms were fabricated from different materials using different techniques. Unfortunately, up to date these processes showed notable complications in multi-steps fabrication of nanowires and micron-size contacting points. Recent studies reported to overcome this problem using micron-scaled chips and nanowires from various materials which were aligned and deposited using dielectrophoresis (DEP)[2]-[3]. This was followed by various methods for gluing the nanowires to the fabricated micron-sized contacts which is time consuming and lacks reproducibility,[4]-[5]. Thus, the bottleneck is the challenge of how to create with good reproducibility an easy and fast contact of nano-electrodes with the micro-connectors. This challenge magnifies with the increased number of nanowires …

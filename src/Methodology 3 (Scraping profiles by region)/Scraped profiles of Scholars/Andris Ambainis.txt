Publication: The difference between average-case and worst-case complexities is one of the central topics in theoretical computer science, and it has been extensively studied for decades. In the quantum setting, however, only a few results are known. This paper shows a super-linear tight gap between the average-case and worst-case quantum query complexities over the families of Boolean functions defined by a natural parameter. More concretely, we consider the size of the on-set of a Boolean function f, ie, the number of inputs for which f= 1, as the parameter, and give the tight gap over the families of N-variable Boolean functions with on-set size M for poly (N)≤ M≤ 2N/2.

Citations: 
Authors:Andris Ambainis
Publication_date: 1997
Publication: The topic of this thesis is applications of well-orderings and ordinals in inductive inforr-nce. Inductive inference is a branch of theoretical computer science that studies the process of learning on a very general level [: 2.5. 7, 41]. Traditionally. inductive inference studies the learning of arbitrary recursive functions (or languages). A lear ning algorithm receives data about an unknown function (language) and outputs a sequence of conject ures about this fuction. Each conjecturr-is a program in a general programming language computing some function (or a grammar for a language). The learning algorithm succeeds when it outputs a correct program (granimar).

Citations: 
Authors:Andris Ambainis
Publication_date: This project studies mathematical Konane in three directions. First, it is shown that, for some 1 n Konane positions, fragments separated by 2 empty squares can be treated as separate positions. Although these fragments can interact, the moves causing interaction always give worse results than other moves.
Second, a Konane position equal to 2? 115 is presented and it is shown that this position is the smallest possible positive number among positions of its type (1 White and many black squares). We conjecture that it is the smallest possible positive number among all 18 18 Konane positions. Third, almost symmetric corner positions are analysed. It is shown that their values can be considerably di erent from completely symmetric corner positions considered by Ernst 1].

Publication_date: 1. Introduction. Soifer [5] conjectured that one can always place any finite collection of squares with area 1 inside a square of area 2 (with no overlapping). Stong [6] proved this conjecture. Stong’s solution begins by sorting the squares by area. We consider an on-line version of the problem. Let S be a square. We are given squares sq1, sq2,..., sqn one at a time such that∑ n i= 1
AREA (sqi)≤ 1. As soon as you see sqi place it in S, so that you never have two squares overlapping. How big does S need to be in order to always be able to do this? We know that S must be have area at least 2 (this is easily seen to be true in the usual version of the problem). We will later show that S of area 4 suffices.

Publication_date: Soifer 5] conjectured that one can always place any nite collection of squares with area 1 inside a square of area 2 (with no overlapping). Stong 6] proved this conjecture. Stong's solution begins by sorting the squares by area. We consider an on-line version of the problem. Let S be a square. We are given squares sq1; sq2;:::; sqn one at a time such that Pn i= 1 AREA (sqi) 1. As soon as you see sqi place it in S, so that you never have two squares overlapping. How big does S need to be in order to always be able to do this? We know that

Publication_date: We consider inductive inference (learning) of recursive (computable) functions. Here, the power of probabilistic algorithms increases as the probability of success decrease. The pattern of this increase depends on the exact requirements about learning algorithm. Typically, the interval of success probabilities] 0; 1] can be split into subintervals such that the power of algorithms with the success probabilities in the same subinterval is the same. The structure of these intervals (called probability hierarchy) is simple in some cases and very complicated in some other cases. Finite identi cation is one of simplest criteria of success for inductive inference. It was the rst criteria for which probabilistic identi cation was studied. However, it also generates one of most complicated probability hierarchy and a large part of this structure remains unknown after 19 years of study (since 1979). The structure is simpler when larger probabilities of success are required. However, when the probabilities of success decrease, it becomes more complex and even small advances require large e orts. We take an approach di erent from the previous work. Instead of trying to describe the probability hierarchy by explicit formulas, we study the properties of the whole hierarchy. We show several interesting results for Popperian nite identi cation, a special case of nite identi cation.
Our main result is a decision algorithm for the probability hierarchy. This algorithm takes two probabilities as the input and answers whether the learning with these two probabilities has equal power. We also determine the ordering type of the probability hierarchy. It is 0, the ordering type of all expressions …

Publication_date: We use quantum walks to construct a new quantum algorithm for element distinctness and its generalization. For element distinctness (the problem of finding two equal items among N given items), we get an O (N^{2/3}) query quantum algorithm. This improves the previous O (N^{3/4}) query quantum algorithm of Buhrman et. al.(quant-ph/0007016) and matches the lower bound by Shi (quant-ph/0112086). The algorithm also solves the generalization of element distinctness in which we have to find k equal items among N items. For this problem, we get an O (N^{k/(k+ 1)}) query quantum algorithm.

Publication_date: Alice and Bob want to know if two strings of length n are almost equal. That is, do they differ on at most a bits? Let 0< a< n-1. We show that any deterministic protocol, as well as any error-free quantum protocol (C* version), for this problem requires at least n-2 bits of communication. We show the same bounds for the problem of determining if two strings differ in exactly a bits. We also prove a lower bound of n/2-1 for error-free Q* quantum protocols. Our results are obtained by lower-bounding the ranks of the appropriate matrices.

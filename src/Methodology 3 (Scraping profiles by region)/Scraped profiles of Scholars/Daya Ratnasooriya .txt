Authors:WD Ratnasooriya, GAS Premakumara
Publication_date: 1998
Publication: This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of a water extract of mature leaves of Pital of betle on libido and fertility of male rats. The dose and treatment regimen used has been previously shown to inhibit male sexual behaviour of rats (I mL of crude extract, three times on a single day .given orally). The libido and fertility were assessed on day of treatment and days 3, 7, 14. 28, or 35 post-treatment by pairing each treated male overnight with a prooestins female rat. The results showed that the extract was devoid of overt signs of toxicity but inhibited libido on the day of treatment and impaired fertility (in terms of quantal pregnancy, number of uterine implants and implantation index) on the day of treatment and on days 3, 7 and 28 post- treatment. The antifertility effec was accompanied with moderate to sever oligozoospermia and a profound enhancement in pre-implantation losses. It is likely that oligozoospermia resulted from ejaculatory disfunction and pre-implantation loss via disruption offertilizing potential of sperm. On the other hand, the anti-libido effect may have resulted from enhance clearance of androgens and/or altered binding to androgen binding protein.

Publication_date: 2003
Publication: Ruellia tuberosa Linn.(Acanthaceae) roots are claimed to possess gastroprotective activity according to some Sri Lankan traditional medical practitioners although this has not been indicated in Ayurveda or folk medicine or confirmed by scientific experimentation. The aim of this study was to evaluate gastroprotective potential of R. tuberosa roots using a crude aqueous extract (470, 940, 1880 mg/kg) and using rat alcohol induced gastric lesion model. Results showed a strong and dose-dependent gastroprotective activity (in terms of reduction in length of haemorrhagic gastric lesions). The extract also had a mild erythropoietic and moderate analgesic activities and was well tolerated even with subchronic treatment. It is concluded that the data provided scientific evidence to support the claim that R. tuberosa root extracts have gastroprotective activity.

Three doses of the ARE (400, 800 and 1200 mg/kg), chloroquine or distilled water (DW) v/as orally administered for 3 consecutive days and the schizonticidal activity was examined in the Plasmodiun) yoelii murine model. The ARE exhibited dose dependent schizonticidal activity, the highest being recorded at 800 mg/kg dose. Oral administration of ARE at 800 mg/kg dosage significantly (p< 0.05) suppressed the parasitaemia by 60.88% compared with the control. However, the ARE was 40% less potent than chloroquine in the P. yoeUi murine model. The ARE was well tolerated by mice over a period of 30 days showing no overt signs of toxicity, stress and hepatic (in tenns of serum SCOT …

Publication_date: 2003
Publication: Anisomeles indica (Lamiaceae) is a wild perennial herb growing in South and South East Asia. A decoction of leaves and stems of this plant is said to be diuretic but this point has not been verified in a controlled scientific investigation. The aim of the study was to scientifically investigate the diuretic activity of the decoctions of leaves and stems of both preflowenng (El) and flowering (E2) plants. Rats were used for experiments. The results showed that A. indica has powerful diuretic action and justify the use of the plant in traditional medicine in Sri Lanka. It is concluded that only the preflowering plants possessed marked diuretic activity. The selection of proper stage of the plant is vital for the induction of diuresis.

Publication: In Brazil Scoparia dulcis Lin.(Family: Scrophulanaceae) is used as an analgesic but not in Sri Lanka due to some unknown reasons. The aim of diis study was to c-camine pain relieving potentials of local plants of S. dulcis in rats using plant decoction. The results showed dose-de pendent analgesic (in hot plate and formalin tests) and antihyperalgesic activities (in carrageenan induced hyperalgesic model). These pain relieving activities were accompanied with sedative action. It is concluded that local S. dulcis plants also have analgesic activity as Brazilian plants and, in addition, have marked sedative and antihyperalgesic effects.

Publication_date: 2000
Publication: This study examined the sex ratios and size range of small cetaceans caught on the west coast of Sri Lanka, in the fish landing sites of Beruwala and Negombo, where accidental entrapment and intentional harpooning occurs. Monitoring was done from May to October 1994. A total of 588 specimens of 12 species (Stenella longirostris, Stenella coeruleoalba, Stenella attenuata, Tursiops truncatus, Grampus griseus, Peponocephala electra, Pseudo rea erassidens, Feresa attenuata, Kogia brevieeps, Kogia simus, Steno bredanensis, Lagenodelphis hose i) were recorded. The proportion of sexes was significantly different between sites. In most species females were longer than males but there was no significant sexual dimorphism in any species recorded. In most commonly caught species a larger percentage were juveniles and sub-adults. The study concludes that there is a female bias in the catch at Beruwala with the avera! number of females caught being significantly higher than the number of males. A significant difference between sites in the size of males of the species Stenella longirostris and females of Tursiops truncatus indicates that more than one form (coastal and offshore) of these species may occur around Sri Lanka, similar to previous records from the eastern tropical Pacific for S. longirostris and from the north Pacific for T truncatus. A larger percentage of juveniles and sub-adults being caught indicates the possibility of an adverse impact on populations in the future due to an eventual dearth of breeding adults and diminishing replacement levels.

Publication: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety profile of cold ethanolic extract (CEE) and hot water extract (HWE) of Sri Lankan Piper betle Linn, leaves (Family: Piperaceae). The extracts were orally administrated to rats for 42 consecutive days. These rats were monitored for overt signs of toxicity, stress, morbidity, aversive behaviors or mortality throughout the experiment. Weight gain, food and water intake were determined weekly. On day 1 post treatment, the rats were sacrificed, blood collected and organs were weighed. The results showed that both extracts were well tolerated in terms of% weight gain, food and water intake, morbidity, aversive behaviors, mortality, blood haematology, serum analysis and organ weights except the weight of the spleen, which suggested lymphoproliferative activity.

Publication_date: 2008
Publication: The antinociceptive potential of Pleurotus cystidiosus, an edible mushroom (family: Tricholomataceae) was investigated in male rats (doses used: 125, 500, and 1000 mg/kg) and female rats in the di-oestrous stage using the standard hot plate and tail flick tests. In the hot plate test, the reaction time was significantly (P< 0.05) prolonged in male rats after 2 h of administration (18% mid and 93% high dose). The di-oestrous female rats also showed significant (P< 0.05) prolongation in the reaction time on the hot plate test (22%) upon administration of the high dose. This antinociceptive activity had the peak effect at 2 h in male rats and the activity was dose dependent (r^= 0.81, p< 0.05). In contrast, none of the rats showed an increase in reaction time in the tail-fUck test. The acetone and methylene chloride extracts of P. cystidiosus was also orally administered to the rats and antinociceptive activity investigated. Only the …

Publication_date: 2007
Publication: This study examined the blood anticlotting potential of Sri Lankan black tea using high gro\Dust No 1, BOPF and BOP grades and citrated shed goat blood. Different concentrations of these three grades of tea (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5 mg/ml) were made in isotonic saline (0.9% NaCk w/v) using freeze dried tea samples. The results showed that the highest dose of all tea grades significantly (P< 0.05) prolonged the calcium-induced in vitro clotting time upto 24 h (the longest time investigated). A similar anticlotting activity was also evident with different concentrations of decaffeinated Dust No 1 and BOPF samples (decaffeinated BOP not investigated), It is concluded that Sri Lankan black tea possess strong blood anticoagulant activity at least, in vitro.

Publication: The objective of this study was to evaluate the antidiuretic potential of Scoparia dulcis Linn (Family Scrophulariaceae) herb using the hydrated rat assay technique with three concentrations (2, 4 or 8 g) of decoction (DE made according to the traditional system of medicine in Sri Lanka. The DE or reference drug (ADH) or vehicle (water) wa orally administered to rats and their urine output was monitored over 6 h. AH three doses of DE caused profound am significant impairments of total urine output. The antidiuretic effect had a rapid onset (within 2 h) and short duration o action (2 h). The DE was well tolerated and was neither hepatotoxic nor nephrotoxic. Further, DE increased the specifn gravity and osmolarity of urine. It is concluded that antidiuretic action was mediated either via ADH like action o potentiation of endogenous ADH action and the DE has the potential to be used as an antidiuretic in Ayurvedic treatment

Publication_date: 1995
Publication: Materials and methods: Mature and fresh M. koenigii leaves were plucked from a tree at a home garden in Polgasowita, Sri Lanka. The identity of the leaves was authenticated by Professor RNF de Focnscka, Department of Botany, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. 2 kg of the leaves were crushed with 750 mL of distilled water using a domestic crusher (John Oster Manufacturing Co., New York, USA). The resulting slurry was then squeezed and filtered through muslin, and the filtrate (extract) stored at 4 C until use. The concentration of the extract was determined by evaporating 250 mL with excess methanol (Petroleum Corporation, Sapugaskanda, Sri Lanka) at 60±5 C to dryness and measuring the residua! weight. The methanol makes a low boiling aceotropic mixture, which facilitates evaporation.
Cross-bred female albino rats (175-225 g) from our own colony were used. They were housed individually in raised mesh bottomed cages (to prevent coprophagia) under standardised animal house conditions (temperature: 28-30 C, photoperiod about 12 h light and 12 h dark, relative humidity 50-55%) with free access to pelleted food (Oils and Fats Co., Ltd. Seeduwa, Sri Lanka) and tap water. Food was' withheld for 36 h and tap water for 12 h, before the commencement of each experiment. All studies were carried out using 5-12 rats per group.

Publication: Materials and methods: Fresh mature leaves of Ficus tsiela were plucked from a tree growing at the National Zoological Gardens. Dehiwala. TTiey were cut into small pieces and 6.0 kg immersed in a methanol-dichloromethane (Petroleum Corporation, Colombo, Sri Lanka)(LI, 5.0 L) solvent system and stored for 14 days at 30±1 C to obtain a gummy and blackish crude extract (yield 2.1 g kg"'). Traces of any organic solvents were removed by storing the crude extract in vacuo overnight at 30±\C.
The crude extract (10.0 g) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA)(15.0 g) were separately dissolved in methanol-dichloromethane (1: 1, 100 mL each). Tlie two resulting solutions were then mixed and concentrated under negative pressure at 30±TC to obtain a brownish PVP co-precipitate. Traces of any residual organic solvents were removed Dy storing the co-precipitate in vaccuo overnight at 30±TC. The co-prccipitate was dissolved in distilled water for oral intubation to the experimental animals. The experimental animals were Sprague Dawley male rats from our own colony (weight: 250±20 g, age: 120-140 days). They were housed in groups, under standardised animal house conditions, with free access to pelleted food (Oils and Fats Co. Ltd., Siduwa, Sri Lanka) and tap water. The sedative potential of the extract was evaluated using the rat hole-board technique described in detail by File and Wardrill [3]. Two doses were tested, using single acute gastric intubation: 1,000 mg kg"'(n-8) and 2,000 mg kg"'(n= 8). Vehicle control used was 1,500 mg kg"'PVP {n= 8).

We have identified and described five main types of day roosts of Sri Lankan bats (Tree tops, foliage including tents, caves, buildings and crevices). Some species show the generalist roosting pattern where as some have strict affinity to a particular kind of roost. During the course of our investigations we recorded maternity roosts of several species, details of which were hitherto unknown. Our observations show that Wavul pena cave is occupied by six species of bats making it probably the largest sympatric roost of bats in the world. By banding bats we have shown that bats from other caves (Wavulgalge) migrate to this cave, most probably because of its unique microclimatic conditions. Breeding patterns of Sri Lankan bats were poorly documented and our studies show that the majority of Sri Lankan bat species have well defined annual cycle of …

Publication: The sedative potential of a Sri Lankan endemic plant species, Argyreia populifolia Choisy (Family: Convolvulaceae) was tested using the leaf extract (2.5, 5.0 and lO. O ml/kg) on rats by placing them in the rat hole board apparatus. The extract had no sedative effect on male and oestrous rats. In contrast, in dioestrous rats, all the 3 doses of the extract tried and in pro-oestrous rats the highest dose induced marked sedation. The sedative effect had a slow onset and short duration of action. The sedative action of the extract was blunted in ovarectomised rats (rats whose both ovaries were removed) and in dioestrous rats treated with oestradiol. The extract had no toxic effects but phytochemical screening revealed the presence of flavonoids and alkaloids.! t was concluded that the sedation of A. populifolia leaf extract is mediated by its antihistamine activity via its alkaloids.

Publication: The aim of this study was to scientifically document the components of the diets usually given to domesticated elephants of Sri Lanka (Elephas maxim us maximus). The study was conducted between April, 1993 and April, 1994 in 13 of the 24 administrative disricts of the country and was based on 140 domesticated elephants. The respective mahouts and/or owners of these elephants were also interviewed. The results show that the elephants are gi ven a standerd menu consisting of 3 main items [(kitullogs (Caryota urenus L.), coconut fronds (Cocus nucifera L.) and jak branches (Artocarpus integrifolia L.)] and 10 supplementary items [leaves of pota wel (Pothos scandens L.), gonna (Ficus callosa L.), palu (Minilkara hexandra Roxb.), nuga (Ficus bengalensis L.), na (Ficus racemosa L.), attika (Adathoda vasica Nees.), budeliya (Totracera sarmetosa L.), and erabadu (Erythrina variegata F. V. Muell.), leaves and stems of banana (Musa acuminata Colla.)]. Two of the main items, namely kitullogs and coconut fronds are given either singly [weight of Kitul (Caryota urens L.): 273 ± 5.9 kg./day] or in combination [ weight of kitul (Caryota urens) 139 ± 2.9kg/ day and weights of coconut (Cocus nucifera L.) 157±2.8kg/day] withJak (Artocapus integrifolia L.) branches (48 ± 0.94 kg/day). All the elephants were given fruits [banana (Musa acuminata L.), pineapple (Ananas cosmus Lindl.), mango (Mangifera indica L.), wood apple (Feronia limonia L.), papaya (Carica papaya L.), water melon (Citrillus vulgaris Schrad.), sugar cane (Saccharum officinale L.),] and vegetables [bread fruit, jak fruit (Artocarpus integrifolia L.), pumpkins (Cucubita moschata Duch …

Publication_date: 1991
Publication: This study examines the post-coital contraceptive potential of a methanolic extract of Abrus precatorius seeds using albino rats. The major constituent of this extract was found to be abrin, an amino acid derivative (68 % by weight). Furthermore, the extract had no steroidal constituents. Oral administration of the extract using various dose and time -regimens (single dose of 150mg Ikg on day I of pregnancy; twice daily dose of 150mglkg on day 1 of pregnancy; a single dose of 300mglkg, on day 1 of pregnancy; and 300mglkg dose from day 1-7 of pregnancy) did not suppress fertility significantly. However, a tendency towards foetal aggregation was evident. It is concluded that the polar fractions of this seed (presumably abrin), has very little potential as a post-coital contraceptive agent.

Publication_date: 2006
Publication: This study examined the gastroprotective activity of vishnukranti kalka (paste) which is recommended in Ayurveda for the treatment of peptic ulcers. The kalka was made by mixing the dry powder of the whole plant of Evolvulus alsinoides L with cow ghee, bee honey and common sugar (1 :2:2: I w/w). The gastroprotective activity was tested using the rat alcohol induced gastric lesion model following oral administration of either the kalka (1250 mg/kg, 2500 mg/kg, 5000 mg/kg), placebo- 1 (5000 mg/kg of wheat flour, cow ghee, bee honey and common sugar), placebo-2 (5000 mg/kg of cow ghee, bee honey and common sugar), cimetidine (100 mg/kg) and distilled water. The results showed a strong and dose depended gastroprotective activity of vishnukranti kalka (in terms of length and number of macroscopical mucosal haemorrhagic lesions). Placebo-I and placebo-2 also had gastroprotective activity but was less potent to kalka. Vishnukranti kalka significantly increased the pH of gastric juice and its mucus and carbohydrate contents. The kalka was well tolerated even with chronic administration with no renaltoxicity (in terms of urea and cratinine), hepatotoxicity (in terms of SGOT and SGPT) and haematotoxiciry (in terms of packed cell volume, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, and haemoglobin concentrations). It is concluded that vishnukranti kalka has strong and safe oral gastroprotective activity and the study also provides scientific evidence for the justification of its use as a gastroprotective agent in Ayurvedic medicine.

Publication_date: 2005
Publication: The aim of this study was to investigate the antidiarrhoeal potential of a decoction (D) made from Scoparia dulcis Linn (Family: Scrophulariaceae), as indicated by traditional practitioners in Sri Lanka, using the caster oil-induced diarrhoeal rat model. Different doses ofD (500,1500,3000 rng/kg) were orally administrated and antidiarrhoeal activity monitored over a 6 h period. The D induced a significant (P<0,05) and dose- dependent antidiarrhoeal effect from Ih post treatment. This antidiarrhoeal action was mediated via an inhibition in intestinal transit due to impairment of intestinal peristalsis, rather than to an increment in intestinal fluid absorption and/or reduction in secretion. The decoction may have a potential in symptomatic relief of non-specific acute diarrhoeas.

Different doses of the WE (0,125, 250, 500 or 1000 mg/kg) were orally administered and one hour later the effects on nociception and sedation were determined using hot plate and tail flick test and rat hole board technique. The WE had no analgesic or sedative effect but exhibited marked hyperalgesic action determined in the hot plate test indicating that this effect was mediated supraspinally. The hyperalgesic activity was dose-dependent with an ED50 value of 585.7 mg/kg. The WE extract was well tolerated even after subacute treatment; with no sums of overt toxicity, hepatotoxicity, haematoxicity, stress or motor impairments. Further, WE did not induce any aversive behaviour characteristic of painlike syndrome.

Publication_date: 2000
Publication: In one of the Ayurvedic treatise 'Patoladi' decoction (PD) consisting of five ingredients (Terminalia chebula Retr, Terminalia belerica Roxb, Phyllenthus emblica Linn. Trichosanthes cucumarina Linn, Azadirachta indica A, Juss.i is recommended for the treatment of 'Amlapitta' (dyspepsia/ gastritis). This indicates that PD may posses gastroprotective action. The aim of this study was to investigate this possibility in rats using ethanol- induced gastric lesions. Different concentrations of freshly prepared PD was either orally [30% (n=6), 15% (n=o), 7.5% (n=o) of 0% (n=6)] or% IP [30%(n=6), 7.5% (n=6), or (n=6)] administered to fasted rats. 30 min later, ImL of absolute ethanol was orally administered to these rats and 1 h later the number and length of gastric linear haemorrhagic lesions were determined. The results show that both treatments of PD markedly and significantly impaired the number and the length of gastric lesions. The PD did not significantly alter the volume, pH, free and total acidity and peptic activity of the gastric content. But, it caused significant increase in carbohydrate and mucus content of the gastric mucus layer. This may be the main mechanism of action of PD. We conclude that PD has potent gastroprotective action and may be therapeutically useful in the treatment of 'Amlapitta' in Ayurvedic Medicine in Sri Lanka.

Publication_date: 1994
Publication: Melatonin, a hormone secreted by the pineal gland is preesnt in the semen and melatonin binding sites have been demonstrated on the plasma membrane of sperm. These observations suggest a possible modulatory role of melatonin on sperm function. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of melatonin on motility of human sperm in vitro. The concentration tested were 75, 150, 300, 450 and 900 pg mL-1 and the period of investigation was 120 min. The results show that, at all concentrations tested, melatonin suppressed motility of sperm. This antimotility effect was not dose-dependent but was time-dependent ; the greatest inhibition for a particular concentration being evident at the highest time point of incubation. Melatonin was not necrospermic but was only spermiostatic. Furthermore, it did not markedly alter the functional integrity of sperm of plasma membrane as revealed from the hypoosmotic swelling test. It is suggested that the sperm antimotility effect of melatonin may be due to its membrane stabilizing actions.

The identity of these fruits were authenticated by Professor RN dc Fonseka of the Department of Botany, University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. The fruits were washed in tap water, deseeded and cut into thin slices. These were immediately minced in a domestic mincer (National, Model; MX-T 1 lOPN, Matsushita Electric Co. Lid, Taiwan) and the pulp obtained was squeezed through four layers of medical gauze. The filtrate was stored at-2 (fC until use. The extract had a greenish appearance. Healthy adult cross bred male albino rals {weight: 2 (X)-25 () g) from the Zoology Department colony were used. They were housed in groups (6 per cage) under standardised animal house conditions, with free access to pelleted food (Oils and Fats Co-Ltd, Seeduwa, Sri Lanka) and tap water up to 12 h before the commencement of the experiment. The analgesic potential of the extract was evaluated in rats (in five groups each consisting of six animals) using a tail flick analgesic meter (Model MK 330A. Muromachi Kikai Co, Ltd.

Publication: Objectives:
To evaluate the effect of brans of selected Sri Lankan traditional red rice varieties on physiological free radicals scavenging potential using in vitro antioxidant assays.
Materials and Methods:
Freeze dried 70% ethanolic extracts of brans of four traditional red rice varieties namely Sudu Heeneti, Goda Heeneti, Dik Wee and Masuran were used. Antioxidant activities were evaluated using superoxide radical scavenging activity (SRSA), nitric oxide radical scavenging activity (NORSA) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity: ORAC (measure of peroxyl radical scavenging activity) in vitro antioxidant assays (n=3 each).
Results and Discussion:
Brans of all the selected varieties showed SRSA, NORSA and ORAC. The observed antioxidant activities varied significantly (P<0.05) among varieties. SRSA and NORSA were significantly high (P<0.05) in brans of Masuran and Sudu Heeneti respectively. For ORAC …

Authors:WD Ratnasooriya, JRAC Jayakody
Publication_date: 2005
Publication: Several drugs, which induce epididymal contractions, have been tested as potential male contraceptives. Vasopressin is one such agent, which has not been tested as a potential male contraceptive acting via epididymis. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of vasopressin on male reproductive competence using rats. Two doses of vasopressin (0.2 LU. and 0.4 IU.! rat) was injected daily to the cauda epididymides of rats for 7 consecutive days. These rats were individually paired with a receptive female on days 1,3 and 7 of treatment and on day 7-post treatment. The results show that both doses of vasopressin caused the production of oligozoospermic ejaculates. In addition, the higher dose induced marked teratozoospermia (decapitation of sperm heads). However, precoital sexual behavior and fertility of treated rats remained uninhibited. At autopsy, sperm granulomas were evident close to vaso-epididymal junction. The most likely cause for the production of vasopressin-induced oligozoospermia was the presence of sperm granulomas. In addition, ejaculatory dysfunction may playa role in the production of oligozoospermia, The possible cause for teratozoospermia is sperm toxicity.

Authors:WD Ratnasooriya, SSK Ratnayake, YNA Jayatunga
Publication_date: 2002
Publication: Icon® is a type II synthetic pyrethroid insecticide based on active ingredient Lambda cyhalothrin (10% w/w). In a recent study it was evident that this insecticide although induced marked signs of stress and other overt signs of toxicity in pregnant rats it never provoked aversive behaviours: suggestive of antinociceptive activity. Hence this study was conducted to investigate the possible antinociceptive potential of leon® on pregnant rats. Different doses ofIcon® 0, 63,83 or 125 mg/ kg body weight/day (active ingredient 0,6.3,8.3, 12.5 mg / kg body weight/day) was orally administered to pregnant (early, mid and late) rats for seven consecutive days and antinociception potential was determined using the hot plate technique. The results showed a marked antinocicpetive activity (in terms of prolongation of reaction time) of leon in pregnant rats. It is concluded that the antinociception is mediated by both specific (neuronal) and non specific (stress and food inhibition) mechanisms.

Publication: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a methanolic and water extract of Withania somnifera (L) Dunal roots on early pregnancy of rats. Female rats (n= 10/group) were orally administered with either 500 or 3000 mg/kg/day ofmethanolic extract or 500 mg/kg/day of water extract of root consecutively from days 1-7 of pregnancy. On day 14 of pregnancy, animals were laparotomised under mild ether anesthesia under aseptic conditions, and the number of implantation sites, resorption sites, viable embryos and copora leutea were noted. Withania somnifera root extracts showed no abortifacient and antifertility effects when administered orally to female rats during early pregnancy. Further the extracts. were well tolerated. The result obtained from this study is in contrast to its claimed effect as an abortifacient in traditional medicine in several countries.

Publication: Patoladi Ghanasara (PG) consisting of five ingredients (Termimlia chebule Retz; Terminania belarica Roxb; Phillenthus emblica Linn; Tricosenthus cucumarina Linn; Azadirachta indica A Juss) is recommended for the treatment of gastric lesions (Amlapitta) in Ayurvedic medicine. Recently, we showed using rat ethanol-induced gastric lesion technique that Patoladi decoction has strong gastroprotective activity when given orally. The aim of this study was to investigate whether semisolid preparation of this decoction, namely (PG) has gastroprotective activity when assessed with the same technique and method of administration. Three different concentrations of the PG were used: 30%, 15% and 7.5%. The results show that PG has overall gastroprotective activity but is less effective than PD (in terms of both number and length of gastric haemorrhgic lesions).

Publication: Leaves of Argyreia populifoLia Choisy (Convolvulaceae) is used in traditional medicine for inflammation in joints and Arthropod bites. However, the pharmacological confirmation for anti-inflammatory activity of the leaves are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory action of the leaves using carrageenan-induced paw oedema test in rats. 10 mllkg oral dose of fresh juice of the leaves significantly impaired the initial phase of the acute inflammatory response (by 33%) in this model. The juice showed a marked anti-histamine activity when assessed using histamine-induced vascular permeability test. It was concluded that the leaf juice has anti-inflammatory activity mediated via antihistamine action justifying its use in traditional medicine.

Publication_date: 1999
Publication: The population and community characteristics of ecto-parasites of bats in Sri Lanka have not been previously examined. The aim of the present study was to investigate these attributes based on incidence, density, prevalence and species composition of ecto-parasites harboured by 3 species of cave-dwelling microchiropteran hosts, Hipposideros lankadiva, H. speoris and Rhinolophus rouxi. These bats were captured by hand or mist nets at four previously selected sites, distributed in the wet, dry and intermediate zones of Sri Lanka. Parasites were both hand-picked and brushed off the pelage from slightly anaesthetised bats. Five species of bat flies including 2 nycteribiid flies (Phthiridium ceylonicum and P. phillipsi ), 3 streblid bat flies, Brachytarsina modesta, B. pygialis and Raymondia pagoda rum and mites offamilies laelapidae, spintumicidae and trombiculidae were recorded on these hosts. With the exception of the two streblid flies and individuals of the three mite families, the other ecto-parasites were host specific. The highest incidence and density were recorded for laelapid and spintumicid mites on H. lankadiva, while lowest values for these indices were also for the same mites on R. rouxi in the intermediate zone. No significant difference (2-way ANOV A; P> 0.05) in the prevalence of ecto-parasites could be attributed either to the sex or the climatic zone of the host with respect to R. rouxi and H. speoris. The ecto-parasite species diversity on H. speoris in the dry zone was observed to be the highest and that on H. lankadiva in the wet zone the lowest. A significant difference in the ecto-parasite assemblage of all hosts were observed …

Publication: This study examines the effect of carbachol, a potent cholinoceptor agonist drug, on fertility of male rats, when administered to epididymis using stlastic formulations, in the form of rods. 10% and 25% carbachol rods were found to be toxic, and resulted in death within 25 min. On the other hand, 5% rods were tolerable. These rods significantly reduced sperm numbers both in the cauda epididymis and ejaculate but failed to Impair fertility. Libido (sexual desire) remained essentially unaltered. In organ bath experiments, carbachol induced rhythmic contrations in isolated vasa deferentia and cauda epididymal tubules in a ' dose-related manner.

Publication: The antifertility effects of naproxen, a prostaglandin synthesis inhibiting drug, were investigated in male rats. A dose of 14 mg/kg/day administered orally for 7 days caused a significant reduction in fertility which was reversible after withdrawal of the drug. It is suggested that the main cause for the antifertility effect is a change in fertilizing capacity of sperm brought about either by a change in semen biochemistry or by a physiological and/or ultrastructural lesion of sperm resulting from reduction in pro-staglandin levels.

Publication_date: 1984
Publication: The intermediate effect of unilateral ligation of the vas deferens on the morphology and motility of spermatozoa in the cauda epididynis and vas was investigated in adult rats (Wistar,Spraguc-Dawly, and Hooded strains), gerbil,guinea-pig and mice. Three days following the ligation of the vas deferens decapitated sperms were observed in the vas of rats and gerbils but not in guinea-pig and mice. However, in the mice decapitation occurred three months later. The motility, on the other hand, was reduced in all the species. In the epididymis,, the appearance of the sperm was normal three days after ligation in all the species investigated. However, the motility was reduced except in the guinea-pig. It is suggested that alteration in blood supply and occlusion of the lumen of vas are responsible for the observed phenomena.

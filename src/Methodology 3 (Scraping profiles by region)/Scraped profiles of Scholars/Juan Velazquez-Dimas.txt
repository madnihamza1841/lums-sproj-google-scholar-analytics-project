Publication_date: Confined masonry walls are the most usual structural system in developing countries like Mexico for residential houses. Holes like windows are the more significance variable on the overall behavior of walls under lateral loads such as those due to seismic and differential settlements. It has been observed that due to ignorance of builders or deficiencies on the construction practice code requirements about the correct reinforcement around the windows are not satisfied. Experimental results of five confined masonry walls with holes are herein presented. Three were constructed with clay brick and two with concrete bock. The walls showed the same cracking strength, and the wall strengthened with GFRP reached the same strength and stiffness as well as the one constructed according to the specifications of the actual Construction Code. It can be concluded that the use of GRFP strips is a feasible alternative to restore lateral strength and stiffness capacity of walls.

Publication: The nonlinear seismic responses of moment resisting steel frames with energy dissipater devices (EDD) friction-type are studied. The dissipaters are placed in the beam-column joint providing maximum flexibility for space utilization. Several moment resisting steel frames (MRSF), representative of the short, medium and long period regions, and several strong motions, representative of medium and stiff local soil conditions, are used in the parametric study. In addition, the parameters of the device are modified to vary the magnitude of the friction force. The authors and their associates developed a finite element-based algorithm to evaluate the nonlinear seismic response of steel frames in time domain. The algorithm is able to model the behavior of EDD and is used in the study. The numerical study indicates that EDD based on friction of metals can significantly reduce the seismic response of steel frames. It is observed that the magnitude reduction, in terms of interstory displacement, decrease with the fundamental period of the frames, but the reduction for interstory shear is similar for all the frames. No correlation is observed between the reduction of either displacements or shears with the predominant period of the earthquakes. Many plastic hinges are formed in the frame without energy dissipaters, but no plastic hinges are formed, in general, in the frames with dissipaters. It indicates that using energy dissipaters friction-type protect the frames from significantly yielding. In order to quantify the effectiveness of the dissipater, the required equivalent viscous damping to produce the same level of reduction of the base shear as that of the dissipater, is …

Publication_date: The evaluation of the effect of viscous damping and yielding of the material on the reduction of the seismic responses of steel buildings with perimeter moment resisting frames, modeled as three-dimensional (3D) complex multi-degree of freedom (MDOF) systems, constitutes the main objective of this paper. The results are compared with those of equivalent 3D structural representations with spatial moment resisting frames as well as with those of bi-dimensional and equivalent single degree of freedom idealizations. The results indicate that the reduction significantly vary from one earthquake to another, even thought the earthquakes were normalized with respect to the pseudo acceleration evaluated at the fundamental structural period (Sa (T1)), reflecting the influence of the earthquake frequency contents and the contribution of several modes on the structural responses. It is also observed that the reduction produced by damping may be larger or smaller than that of yielding. This reduction can significantly vary from one structural representation to another, and is smaller for global than for local response parameters, which in turn depends on the particular local response parameter and the location of the structural element under consideration. The uncertainty in the estimation is significantly larger for local response parameter and decreases as damping increases. It is concluded that, estimating the effect of damping and yielding on the seismic response of steel buildings by using simplified models may be a very crude approximation. Moreover, the effect of yielding should be explicitly calculated by using complex 3D MDOF models instead of …

26. Multi-component seismic response and multiple response quantities for moment resisting steel frames

Authors:A Reyes-Salazar, A López-Barraza, J Velázquez-Dimas, B Quiñones-Esquivel, J González-Cuevas
Publication_date: In the seismic design of structures, multi-component ground motions should be considered. Most of design codes that address the issue specify that the total response can be obtained from the combination of the individual responses produced by each component. The commonly used rules are the Square Root of the Sum of the Squares (SRSS) and the Percentile Rule. Despite these rules seem to be simple to apply, there are many aspects of the problem that need clarification. They are: a) how to select the critical orientation of the orthogonal components? b) which response quantities are to be combined? should the considered response quantities produced by each component be collinear? and c) should individual or multiple response quantities be considered? The results of this study indicate that the maximum response is obtained for principal components and that the rules estimate the total response very well in the case of individual response parameters. The accuracy of the rules is slightly higher for collinear than for no-collinear individual response parameters. For multiple response parameters, however, the combined response may be underestimated. The underestimation is more for gravity columns than for columns of moment resisting frames and more for columns than for beams. The codes should be more specific regarding the parameters to be combined.

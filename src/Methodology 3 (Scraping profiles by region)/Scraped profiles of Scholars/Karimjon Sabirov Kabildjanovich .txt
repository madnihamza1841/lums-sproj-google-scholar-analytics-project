Publication_date: 2012/10/1
Publication: [en] Full text: Particle transport in nanoscale networks and discrete structures is of fundamental and practical importance. Usually such systems are modeled by so-called quantum graphs, the systems attracting much attention in physics and mathematics during past two decades [1-5]. During last two decades quantum graphs found numerous applications in modeling different discrete structures and networks in nanoscale and mesoscopic physics (eg, see reviews [1-3]). Despite considerable progress made in the study of particle dynamics most of the problems deal with unperturbed case and the case of time-dependent perturbation has not yet be explored. In this work we treat particle dynamics for quantum star graph with time-dependent bonds. In particular, we consider harmonically breathing quantum star graphs, the cases of monotonically contracting and expanding graphs. The latter can be solved exactly …

Authors:DU Matrasulov, E Rakhimov, KK Sabirov
Publication_date: 2012/10/1
Publication: [en] Full text: Billiards are convenient models for the study of classical and quantum dynamics of non-integrable systems. They have been extensively studied both in experimental [1] and theoretical contexts [2, 3]. A remarkable feature of the particle motion in billiards is the dependence of the dynamics on the geometry of the billiard boundaries. Depending on the geometry the dynamics can be regular, mixed or chaotic in the classical case. The corresponding quantum dynamics exhibits certain features in the statistical properties of the energy spectrum. In recent years there is a growing interest in the classical dynamics of time-dependent billiards [4]-[6]. On of the key issue questions that has been investigated is whether there will be Fermi acceleration in such two-dimensional confined geometries. In this work we treat the problem of particle transport in time-dependent rectangular billiard. In particular, by …

Citations: 
Authors:DU Matrasulov, KK Sabirov, ZA Sobirov, D Bobajanov
Publication_date: 2012/10/1
Publication: [en] Full text: The nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) is of importance in many areas of contemporary physics. The early applications of NLSE having soliton solutions were mainly focused in optics, acoustics, particle physics, hydrodynamics and biophysics. However, special attention NLSE and its soliton solutions have attracted because of the recent progress made in the physics and Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). Namely, due to the fact that the dynamics of BEC is governed by Gross-Pitaevskii equation which is NLSE with cubic nonlinearity, finding the soliton solution of NLSE with different confining potentials and boundary conditions is of importance for this area of physics. In this work we treat the stationary (cubic) nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLSE) on simplest graphs. Motivation for the study of NLSE on graphs comes from the different practically important applications such as soliton transport in …

Publication: In this paper we study the nonlinear Schroedinger equation for the quantum graphs. We found the exact solution of the nonlinear Schroedinger equation for the simple graphs consisting of three segments attached in one point. We suppose the method may be generalized to the other topologies and nonlinearities.(authors)

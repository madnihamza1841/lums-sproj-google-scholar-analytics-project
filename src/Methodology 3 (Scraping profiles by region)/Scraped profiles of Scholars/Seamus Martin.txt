Publication: The annual conferences organised by the European Cell Death Organisation are prestigious, popular meetings characterised by scientific excellence. Outstanding researchers present their exciting and thought-provoking data in meetings attended by the most prominent researchers in the field. The last time an ECDO conference (the 6 th Euroconference) organised in Sweden or in Scandinavia was in 1998, an exciting meeting attended by around 150 participants. The ECDO 2011 is the biggest and most important cell death research meeting hitherto organised in Sweden. To celebrate the return to Sweden, we chose Metabolism and Epigenetics as the theme of this meeting, two fields currently in the cutting edge of cell death research.
A traditional and important event preceding the ECDO meeting is the training course “Concepts and methods in programmed cell death”. During this course, well-known experts in the field share their knowledge with young fellows. Such an event ensures the continuation of the ECDO traditions as well as the shaping of the next generation of cell death research leaders. To facilitate the participation in these meetings by as many young fellows as possible, several travel fellowships, sponsored by ECDO, are provided.

Publication: Bcl-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis by controlling the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c via the Bax/Bak channel. However, recent studies have also implicated several members of this family in the regulation of mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics. It has been debated whether the role of Bcl-2 proteins in mitochondrial morphogenesis is functionally distinct from their role in apoptosis, with some arguing that Bax/Bak-induced mitochondrial fission promotes apoptosis-associated cytochrome c release, while others suggest that these functions are separable. Here we review this emerging area and argue for a role for the Bcl-2 family as novel regulators of mitochondrial morphogenesis.

Citations: 
Authors:SEAMUS JOSEPH MARTIN, EMMA CREAGH
Publication_date: 2004
Publication: Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) can block apoptosis through binding to active caspases and antagonizing their function. IAP function can be neutralized by Smac/Diablo, an IAP-binding protein that is released from mitochondria during apoptosis. In addition to their ability to interact with caspases, certain IAPs also display ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity because of the presence of a RING domain. However, it is not known whether the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activities of human IAPs contribute to their apoptosis inhibitory activity or whether this IAP property can be modulated through association with Smac/Diablo. Here we demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase activities of XIAP, and to a lesser extent c-IAP-1 and c-IAP2, are potently repressed through binding to Smac/Diablo. We also show that mutation of the XIAP RING domain rendered this IAP a less effective inhibitor of apoptosis …

Citations: 
Authors:EMMA CREAGH, SEAMUS JOSEPH MARTIN
Publication_date: 2001
Publication: Proteins possessing the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) motif have been implicated in pathways leading to activation of caspases or NF-kappaB in the context of apoptosis or inflammation, respectively. Here we report the identification of a novel protein, CARDINAL, that contains a CARD motif and also exhibits a high degree of homology to the C terminus of DEFCAP/NAC, a recently described member of the Apaf-1/Nod-1 family. In contrast with the majority of CARD proteins described to date, CARDINAL failed to promote apoptosis or NF-kappaB activation. Rather, CARDINAL potently suppressed NF-kappaB activation associated with overexpression of TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, RIP, RICK, Bcl10, and TRADD, or through ligand-induced stimulation of the interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor receptors. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CARDINAL interacts with the regulatory subunit of the IkappaB …

254. Apoptosis-associated release of Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria requires active caspases and is blocked by Bcl-2
Citations: 
Authors:EMMA CREAGH, SEAMUS JOSEPH MARTIN
Publication_date: 2001
Publication: Smac/DIABLO is a mitochondrial protein that potentiates some forms of apoptosis, possibly by neutralizing one or more members of the IAP family of apoptosis inhibitory proteins. Smac has been shown to exit mitochondria and enter the cytosol during apoptosis triggered by UV- or ?-irradiation. Here, we report that Smac/DIABLO export from mitochondria into the cytosol is provoked by cytotoxic drugs and DNA damage, as well as by ligation of the CD95 death receptor. Mitochondrial efflux of Smac/DIABLO, in response to a variety of pro-apoptotic agents, was profoundly inhibited in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells. Thus, in addition to modulating apoptosis-associated mitochondrial cytochrome c release, Bcl-2 also regulates Smac release, suggesting that both molecules may escape via the same route. However, whereas cell stress-associated mitochondrial cytochrome c release was largely caspase independent, release …

Publication_date: This book presents a collection of 29 chapters divided into four different topics: Studies at the neuronal level; Developmental studies; Experimental electrical and neurochemical studies; and Studies in man. All chapters, but one, deal specifically with various problems within these four more general areas. The final chapter by Richard Mark presents an elegant expose of very thoughtful comments on what is discussed in some of the chapters of the book. Although the intellectual quality of these chapters varies quite dramatically, the book on the whole makes very worthwhile reading. The book certainly presents a very rich body of information which should be of considerable use and interest for graduate students and scientists in areas such as histology, biochemistry, neurophysiology, pharmacology, and psychol-% Y.
Despite these apparent advantages, there are also a few difficulties. As I see it, there are three main …

Publication_date: (D) HeLa cells were stimulated with the active IL-1β p17 fragment (2 nM) or anti-Fas IgM (200 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of IL-1 receptor antagonist. After 24 h, apoptosis was scored by annexin V/PI staining by flow cytometry and cytokine concentrations in the culture supernatants were determined by ELISA.(E) HeLa cells were stimulated with TNFα (1 ng/ml) or anti-Fas IgM (200 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of neutralizing TNF antibody. After 24 h, apoptosis and cytokine concentrations were determined as above.(F) HeLa. vector or HeLa. Bcl-xL cells were treated with anti-Fas at the indicated concentrations. After 24 h, apoptosis and cytokine concentrations were determined as in (A). Results shown are representative of least two independent experiments. Error bars represent the mean±SEM of triplicate determinations from a representative experiment.

275. Histological Changes in the Human
Citations: 
Authors:MM MURRAY, SD MARTIN, TL MARTIN, M SPECTOR
Publication_date: Background: Four phases in the response to injury of the ruptured human anterior cruciate ligament are observed histologically; these include an inflammatory phase, an epiligamentous repair phase, a proliferative phase, and a remodeling phase. One objective of this study was to describe the histological changes that occur in the ruptured human anterior cruciate ligament during these phases. Myofibroblast-like cells that contain a-smooth muscle actin are present in the midsubstance of the intact human anterior cruciate ligament. A second objective of this study was to determine whether an increased number of myofibroblast-like cells is found in the midsubstance of the ruptured hu-man anterior cruciate ligament because it was thought that those cells might be responsible in part for the retraction of the ruptured anterior cruciate ligament. In the early phase of this study, it was found that the number of myofibroblast …

278. Plenary session 5: Apoptosis as a drug target
Citations: 
Authors:EM Creagh, SJ Martin
Publication_date: Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a process essential for the regulation of development and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Dysregulation of apoptotic pathways can result in many severe pathological diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. Consequently, there is intense interest in molecular regulators of apoptosis as therapeutic targets.
This talk will introduce the main pathways leading to apoptosis in vivo and the key regulators of these pathways. These include death receptors, which trigger apoptosis; Bcl-2 family members, which regulate the mitochondrial pathway; Caspases, which amplify and execute the apoptotic process and Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs), which keep caspases in check. Therapeutic strategies for modulating the activites of key apoptotic regulators will be discussed, with particular emphasis on caspases and the IAPs.

280. SMAC/Diablo antagonizes XIAP ubiquitin ligase activity to potentiate apoptosis
Citations: 
Authors:Emma M Creagh, Brona Murphy, Colin S Duckett, Seamus J Martin
Publication_date: Inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) can block apoptosis through binding to active caspases and antagonizing their function. IAP function can, in turn, be neutralized by Smac/Diablo—an IAP-binding protein that is released from mitochondria during apoptosis. In addition to their ability to interact with caspases, certain IAPs also display E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity due to the presence of a RING domain in these proteins. However, it is not known whether the E3-ligase activities of the human IAPs contributes to their apoptosis-inhibitory activity, or whether this IAP property can be modulated through association with Smac/Diablo. Here, we demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase activity of XIAP is potently repressed through binding to Smac/Diablo. We also show that removal of the XIAP RING domain rendered this IAP a less effective inhibitor of apoptosis, suggesting that the ubiquitin ligase activity of XIAP contributes to its …

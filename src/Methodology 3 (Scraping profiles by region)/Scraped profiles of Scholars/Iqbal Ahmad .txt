165. 12 Role of Listeria monocytogenes in Human Health: Disadvantages and Advantages
Citations: 2
Authors:Javed A Khan, Ram S Rathore, Shaheen Khan, Fohad M Hussain, Iqbal Ahmad
Publication_date: 2016
Publication: The genus Listeria consists of eight species: Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Listeria ivanovii, Listeria seeligeri, Listeria welshimeri, Listeria grayi, Listeria rocourtii and Listeria marthii. Among Listeria species only
L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii are pathogenic to humans and animals. Unlike L. monocytogenes which causes listeriosis in humans and animals L. ivanovii is solely an animal pathogen. The bacterium may be rod shaped, coccoid or filamentous depending on nutrients, environmental and cultural conditions. Among pathogenic bacteria L. monocytogenes is atypical as it has the ability to survive and grow in a broad temperature range (1–45 C), a wide pH range (4.1–9.6) and it can tolerate sodium chloride concentrations of 5–25% and a variety of other toxic chemicals such as tellurite, acridine dyes, lithium chloride, nalidixic acid and cycloheximide. The bacterium has been found widely in the environment and in humans and animals. L. monocytogenes has emerged as an important food-borne pathogen in human beings, especially in the developed world. Many sporadic cases and outbreaks of listeriosis have been reported linked with the consumption of various plant and animal food products contaminated with L. monocytogenes. Listeriosis can be clinically defined as the presence of the organism in bloodstream, cerebrospinal fluid or in a normally sterile body site. Predominant clinical manifestations of human listeriosis are diarrhoea, meningitis, encephalitis, cerebritis and septicaemia. Besides these manifestations, endocarditis, pericarditis and pyogenic abscesses have also been documented. Most human infections …

Publication_date: 2013
Publication: It is well known that the intake of antioxidants with increased consumption of fruits and vegetables and medicinal herbs contributes towards reduced risk of certain diseases including cancers. This study aims to evaluate the broad-spectrum antioxidant and antimutagenic activities as well as to elucidate phytochemical profile of an Indian medicinal plant Murraya koenigii (curry) leaves. Leaves of the plant were successively fractionated in various organic solvents. Benzene fraction demonstrated the highest phenolic content followed by petroleum ether. The benzene fraction showed maximum antioxidant activity in all tested assays, namely, phosphomolybdenum, 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) assays. Based on the promising broad-spectrum antioxidant activity, benzene fraction was further evaluated for antimutagenic activity and showed a dose-dependent antimutagenic response in Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. It inhibited 72–86% mutagenicity induced by sodium azide, methyl methanesulfonate, benzo (a) pyrene, and 2-aminoflourene at the maximum tested concentration (100 𝜇g/mL) in Salmonella typhimurium tester strains. At least 21 compounds were detected by GC/MS. The findings clearly demonstrated that phenolic-rich benzene fraction has promising broad-spectrum antioxidant and antimutagenic property and needs further evaluation to exploit its therapeutic potential.

Citations: 
Authors:Mohd Sajjad Ahmad Khan, Mohd Musheer Altaf, Abdullah Safar Althubiani, Iqbal Ahmad
Publication_date: Microorganisms under natural conditions do not exist in isolation but form complex ecological interaction webs. They undergo various kinds of interactions with their ecological hosts viz. plants and humans. These interactions may be either beneficial or deleterious to each other. Such behaviors are of fundamental importance to natural cycles and ecosystem functions and are of agricultural, environmental and biomedical interests for humans. In some cases, these are caused by planktonic cells, whereas in most cases they are associated with the structured aggregates of cells termed biofilms. The ability of detecting and investigating these various types of host-microbe interactions are studied through a number of varied methods varying from classical microscopy to advanced microscopy and molecular techniques. Various molecular methods are being used for examining the microbial diversity and activity of environmental samples. However, spatial information at micro-scale, which is fundamental to understand the dynamics of host-microbe interactions, is usually lost during the sample processing. Therefore, it is useful to complement the indirect molecular techniques with direct visualization methods. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) allows the exploration of microbial habitats at a spatial resolution level unattainable with molecular methods. In this chapter, the application of CLSM for the study of host-microbe interactions, including both planktonic and biofilm ways of life, are addressed in the lights of newly developed molecular methods including fluorescent protein tags and advanced microscopic approaches. The application of …

Authors:FARAH AHMAD, IQBAL AHMAD
Publication_date: Soil microbial populations are immersed in a framework of interaction known to affect plant fitness and soil quality. The functions of soil microorganisms are central to decomposition process and nutrient cycling. Though the space occupied by living organisms is less than 5 percent of total space. Therefore, major microbial activity is confined to the ‘hot-spot’ie, agreeable with accumulated organic matter, rhizosphere (Bowen and Roviara, 1999; Tilak et al., 2005). The soil microorganisms and their preparations (biofertilizer, biopesticides and biocontrol agents) and microbe-plant interaction have been known for their significance in maintenance and supply of plant nutrients as well as protecting plant health (Vessey, 2003). Diversity and community structure in the rhizosphere is however influenced by both, plant and soil type (Cavigelli and
Robertston, 2000; Bakker et al., 2002). Plants play an important role in selecting and enriching the types of bacteria by the constituents of their root exudates. The interaction between bacteria may be beneficial, harmful and neutral for the plant and some time effect of a particular bacterium may vary as a consequence of soil conditions (Lynch, 1990). Rhizospheric microorganisms mediate soil processes such as nitrogen fixation, synthesis of plant hormones, phosphate mineralization, decomposition, nutrient mobilization and mineralization. Among these processes, biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) offers an economically attractive alternative and ecologically sound means of reducing external inputs and improving internal resources. Biological nitrogen fixation is estimated to contribute 180 x 106 metric tons/year …

Publication_date: The extracts of leaf, stem and root of Ocimum sanctum, Azadirachta indica and Nigella sativa, were used in the comparative study of total carotene, flavonoids, phenolics and total antioxidant potential. Leaves of Ocimum sanctum, exhibited maximum total carotene content (2.17±0.272 mg/gram fresh weight±SD), while root of Nigella sativa exhibited the lowest (0.29±0.088 mg/gram fresh weight±SD). Flavonoids were found to be maximum in the leaf of Nigella sativa (4.93±0.702 mg equivalent QE/gram of tissue±SD), while minimum in the root of Azadirachta indica (0.16±0.033 mg equivalent QE/gram of tissue±SD). A trend similar to total carotene content was exhibited by phenolics with (34.9±2.427 mg equivalent GA/gram of tissue±SD) in the leaf of Ocimum sanctum as maximum and (6.85±2.005 mg equivalent GA/gram of tissue±SD) in the root of Nigella sativa as minimum. Total antioxidant potential was observed to be maximum in the root of Ocimum sanctum (0.69±0.013 mM equivalent ascorbic acid/g tissue±SD), while minimum was recorded in the leaf of Nigella sativa (0.22±0.028 mM equivalent ascorbic acid/g tissue±SD). The variability when analyzed statistically by two way ANOVA it was found significant with (P-value< 0.05). The present study showed Ocimum sanctum to be an excellent source of antioxidants which can be utilized for therapeutic purposes. However, the specific plant part need to be optimally utilized for specific pharmaceutical/neutraceutical formulation.

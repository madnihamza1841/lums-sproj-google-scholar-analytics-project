Publication_date: Nordic Council of Ministers
Publication: …. Taking the structure and functioning of the Arctic regional economies and the degree of economic dependence as a point of departure, these region's self-reliance and comparative socio-economic performance is analyzed. The fundamental problem is still the dependency Arctic regions have on their mother economies in the south"…. the impact from climate changes and the global economy strongly influence the self-sufficiency constraints and potentials of the Arctic societies. Traditional approaches to economic valuation may not be sufficient to capture these relationships. Neo-classical economics and the trade off model look upon nature as a good commensurable with all other goods, and henceforward there is a substitution possibility. The rational self-interest and homo economicus is however, not the same as responsible self-interest included in ecological economics. This suggests broader approaches to environmental uncertainties, which take into account ethical values and conflicts of interest".

44. 2. Living Conditions in the Arctic 51
Citations: 
Authors:Thomas Andersen, Birger Poppel
Publication_date: This chapter introduces a model for conducting research on living conditions among peoples that have experienced rapid social, cultural and economic change in countries where a non-parallel development has occurred. This model was developed by the researchers of SLiCA, A Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic; Inuit, Saami and the Indigenous Peoples of Chukotka, which was initiated by Statistics Greenland in 1997. The point of departure for this model is a critique of contemporary living conditions surveys carried out by national statistical bureaus in economically, technologically and culturally segmented areas. The point of view is that these studies erroneously assume that the populations they investigate are homogeneous, and that consensus concerning individual social and economic objectives exists. This usually leads to research designs and indicators of individual well-being that reflect the …

45. Economic conditions and migration in Greenland-A preliminary study on migration to and from Greenlandic settlements 1988-1995
Citations: 
Authors:Birger Poppel
Publication_date: The aim of the paper is to give some clues of the recent economic and demographic development of the small settlements. Whereas the total population in the 59 settlements has been stable for more than 10 years there are major fluctuations from region to region. The article suggests that further analyses might confirm the hypothesis that the population in the settlements is more mobile than usually assumed.

47. ARCTIC SOCIAL INDICATORS APPLICATION
Citations: 
Authors:Birger Poppel
Publication_date: The story of how the Arctic was populated is not least about migration. One of the first migration routes departed from the Eastern part of Siberia, crossing the North American continent before arriving in Greenland and continuing either to the East or West of the island. These travel/migration activities endured for generations and origins of ancient people can be traced through myths 1, archaeological findings 2 and, more recently, through insights provided from a human genome of an extinct palaeo-eskimo 3. Thus, links between ancient peoples can be created, which span across the Arctic from the Bering Strait to Greenland.

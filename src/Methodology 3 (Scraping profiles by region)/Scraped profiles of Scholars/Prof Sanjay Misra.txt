Publication: The increasing rate of high (secondary) school leavers choosing academic majors to study at the university without proper guidance has most times left students with unfavorable consequences including low grades, extra year (s), the need to switch programs and ultimately having to withdraw from the university. In a bid to proffer a solution to the issue, this research aims to build an expert system that recommends university or academic majors to high school students in developing countries where there is a dearth of human career counselors. This is to reduce the adverse effects caused as a result of wrong choices made by students. A mobile rule-based expert system supported with ontology was developed for easy accessibility by the students.

Publication_date: 2014/4/4
Publication: Software development is a knowledge intensive activity and its success depends on knowledge and creativity of the developers. In the last years the traditional perspective on software development is changing and agile methods have received considerable attention. Among other attributes, the agilists claim that fostering knowledge sharing and creativity is one of the keys to response to common problems and challenges of software development today. The development of new software products requires the generation of novel and useful ideas. The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of knowledge management and creativity in relation with new software engineering trends. The implications of these findings are considered, and some possible directions for future research are suggested.

Publication_date: 2015
Publication: Mobile computing makes access to data and services available anytime and anywhere. The recent increase in the number of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets has given rise to a phenomenon known as “IT Consumerization” that focuses on satisfying the needs of the consumers to improve their productivity for the benefit of their organization. Recent report from mobile trends indicates that in 2014 alone, manufacturers will ship more than a billion Android devices. It is estimated that seven out of every ten employees (7/10) will use their mobile devices for work in corporate environments. Mobile devices according to studies are known to be more vulnerable compared to laptops and PCs due to their small size, mobility and general lack of protection against viruses and malware. The use of these devices therefore can impact negatively on corporate networks unless properly and effectively managed. Organizations are now adopting a program known as „bring your own device‟(BYOD) that will enable them capture, register, and manage the mobile devices that connect and use their corporate infrastructure to guarantee the security of the infrastructure and data of the organization. They achieve this by putting in place strategies and policies that involves all stakeholders. This paper surveys literature to extract useful information that serve to enlighten the community of workers and IT leaders on the current and rapid growing phenomenon of BYOD, including the strategies for deployment, BYOD models, benefits, security threats on corporate and user data and infrastructure. The study presents guidelines and a framework for adoption of BYOD …

Publication_date: 2014
Publication: The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) cares for all steps to have a sound implementation of projects. So many projects are tested to be delivering but with the test of time, security challenges arise. In cases where projects have executed required tasks for decades, software evolution expands the scope and security requirements increase beyond what the developer initially cared for. This work explores the critical security incorporations that ensure a better security of software so that at any level of evolution, security challenges do not arise. There is always focus on security of design but this work is on information security in the software development life cycle to avoid tampering, endeavour integrity and authentication of information.

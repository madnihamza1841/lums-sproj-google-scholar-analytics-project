Publication: Pseudomonas cepacia lipase (lipase PS) is an efficient enzyme which catalyzes the enantioselective asymmetric esterification and/or hydrolysis reactions in high yields and enantio excess of products. In this review, the role of lipase PS in the asymmetric esterification and hydrolysis of various heterocyclic compounds or their precursors is investigated.

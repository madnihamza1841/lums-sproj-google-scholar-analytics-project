Publication_date: 2013/8/25
Publication: ALIZE is an open-source platform for speaker recognition. The ALIZE library implements a low-level statistical engine based on the well-known Gaussian mixture modelling. The toolkit includes a set of high level tools dedicated to speaker recognition based on the latest developments in speaker recognition such as Joint Factor Analysis, Support Vector Machine, i-vector modelling and Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis. Since 2005, the performance of ALIZE has been demonstrated in series of Speaker Recognition Evaluations (SREs) conducted by NIST and has been used by many participants in the last NIST-SRE 2012. This paper presents the latest version of the corpus and performance on the NIST-SRE 2010 extended task.

Publication: The now-acknowledged vulnerabilities of automatic speaker verification (ASV) technology to spoofing attacks have spawned interests to develop so-called spoofing countermeasures. By providing common databases, protocols and metrics for their assessment, the ASVspoof initiative was born to spear-head research in this area. The first competitive ASVspoof challenge held in 2015 focused on the assessment of countermeasures to protect ASV technology from voice conversion and speech synthesis spoofing attacks. The second challenge switched focus to the consideration of replay spoofing attacks and countermeasures. This paper describes Version 2.0 of the ASVspoof 2017 database which was released to correct data anomalies detected post-evaluation. The paper contains as-yet unpublished meta-data which describes recording and playback devices and acoustic environments. These support the analysis of replay detection performance and limits. Also described are new results for the official ASVspoof baseline system which is based upon a constant Q cesptral coefficient frontend and a Gaussian mixture model backend. Reported are enhancements to the baseline system in the form of log-energy coefficients and cepstral mean and variance normalisation in addition to an alternative i-vector backend. The best results correspond to a 48% relative reduction in equal error rate when compared to the original baseline system.

Publication_date: 2012/9/2
Publication: In this paper, we advocate the use of uncompressed form of i-vector. We employ the probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) to handle speaker and session variability for speaker verification task. An i-vector is a low-dimensional vector containing both speaker and channel information acquired from a speech segment. When PLDA is used on i-vector, dimension reduction is performed twice-first in the i-vector extraction process and second in the PLDA model. Keeping the full dimensionality of i-vector in the supervector space for PLDA modeling and scoring would avoid unnecessary loss of information. The drawback of using PLDA on uncompressed i-vector is the inversion of large matrices, which we show can be solved rather efficiently by portioning large matrix into smaller blocks. We also introduce the Gaussianized rank-norm, as an alternative to whitening, for feature normalization prior to PLDA modeling.

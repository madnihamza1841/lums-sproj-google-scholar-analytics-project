Authors:NC GALLAGHER
Publication_date: 1982
Publication: Two topics of engineering interest have been treated in this research. One is block or vector quantization, which deals with the digital representation of multi-dimensional signals. Two Ph.D. dissertations and one patent application, in addition to numerous technical articles have resulted from this work. The other area of study has been nonlinear signal estimating which has lead to a study of median filtering. This work on median filtering has resulted in two Ph.D. dissertations in addition to a number of technical publications.

189. Theoretical results on the properties of median type operations(nonlinear filtering of digital signals)

Authors:TA NODES, NC GALLAGHER
Publication_date: 1982
Publication: The multivariate output distribution of one and two dimensional median type operations is developed, and this is used in several illustrative examples of the effects of median filtering signals plus additive white noise. In addition, some of the statistics of signals plus white impulsive noise are presented. The effects of one dimensional median filtering on signal bandwidth are discussed, and optimum root estimators are examined. The structure of two dimensional root signals (signals invariant to filtering) for separable median filters is developed. In addition, it is proved that repeated passes of a separable median filter over any image will reduce it to such a root structure except possibly in rarely occurring regions of time varying binary oscillations when larger windows are used. The form of these nonconvergent exceptions is also examined.

Publication: An analysis of kinoform image reconstruction error was presented. This analysis considers the effects of the error introduced by the kinoform approximation and the quantization effects of plotting. A new method for computing kinoforms was presented and compared with other methods. It was found that the aliasing error is a significant problem in kinoform image reconstructions. A new class of optimum spatial filters was developed; this class is optimum for filters with a magnitude constraint on the filter transfer functions. The Fourier transform division filter was discussed and the optimum filter was developed as a special case of the general optimum class. Various methods for improving image reconstruction by altering image phase were discussed. The input image phase and the desired output image phase may be chosen to improve the performance of the filtering system. The statistical properties of the Fourier …

Publication_date: Searching for new ways to compute the number π leads us to an analysis of the geometric approach of Archimedes and the recursive Calculus approach of Newton-Raphson.
Archimedes estimates π by inscribing a circle with a regular polygon and calculates the circumference of the circle using the perimeter of the polygon. Unlike Archimedes, we propose a method using irregular polygons. When the computations are performed with an equal number of sides, the irregular polygon method produces a more accurate value for π than does the regular polygon method.

Publication_date: Publication of this topical issue on signal recovery and synthesis is motivated in part by a topical meeting on the same subject that was held in April 1992, the fourth topical meeting of the triannual series. This is the third topical issue of JOSA A (the previous issue was published in March 1990). The topic signal recovery and synthesis deals broadly with issues that are related to inverse problems. This Feature highlights subjects that one finds in optics and electromagnetics. This is not an intentional limitation on our part but a focus that reflects the interests of the researchers who submitted papers. A class of problems in signal recovery that often appears is reconstruction of an image from data that are somehow incomplete. For example, reconstruction of an image given only its power spectrum is a problem that appears in many different areas, including electromagnetic inverse scattering, crystallography, and ground …

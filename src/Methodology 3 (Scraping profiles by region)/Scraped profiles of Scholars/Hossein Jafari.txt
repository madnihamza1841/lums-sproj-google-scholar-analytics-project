Publication_date: 2012/8/27
Publication: The research area of nonlinear equations has been very active for the past few decades. There are many kinds of nonlinear equations that appear in various areas of physical and mathematical sciences [1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 14, 18]. Much effort has been made on the construction of exact solutions of such nonlinear equations. Nonlinear wave phenomena appears in various scientific and engineering fields, such as fluid mechanics, plasma physics, optimal fiber, biology, solid state physics, chemical physics and geometry.
In recent years, many powerful and efficient methods to find analytic solutions of nonlinear equations have been presented by a diverse group of scientists. These methods include the tanhfunction method, homogeneous balance method, the extended tanh-function method [5, 9] and the sine-cosine method [11, 12].

Publication_date: A flexible job shop scheduling problem with assembly operations and seguence dependent setup time is studied in this paper: In this problem, at the first stage, the parts are processed in a flexible job shop system and then they are assembled in an assembly stage to produce products. Setup time is needed when a machine starts processing the parts or it changes items. At first, a linear model is introduced to express the problem. The objective is to minimice the completion time af all products. The since the problem is MP-hard, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm is presented. The proposed algorithm is called a Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization with a Parallel Jariable Neighborhood Search algorithm (HPSOPITVS). Finally; the numerical experiments are used to evaluate and validate the performance of the mathematical model and proposed algorithm. The computational results show that hybrid algorithm achieves …

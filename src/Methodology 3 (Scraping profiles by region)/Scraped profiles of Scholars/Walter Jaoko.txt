Publication: The development of a rapid and efficient system to identify human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)- infected individuals with broad and potent HIV-1-specific neutralizing antibody responses is an important step toward the discovery of critical neutralization targets for rational AIDS vaccine design. In this study, samples from HIV-1-infected volunteers from diverse epidemiological regions were screened for neutralization responses using pseudovirus panels composed of clades A, B, C, and D and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). Initially, 463 serum and plasma samples from Australia, Rwanda, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and Zambia were screened to explore neutralization patterns and selection ranking algorithms. Samples were identified that neutralized representative isolates from at least four clade/CRF groups with titers above prespecified thresholds and ranked based on a weighted average of …

Publication: The incidence of meningoencephalitis in developing countries is high and its diagnosis being inadequate as it is mainly based on conventional methods with a limited diagnostic capacity for bacterial, fungal and viral detection. This results in prescription of a cocktail of antibiotics, antifungal, or anti-viral drugs, since the causative agent is often unknown. There is therefore need for timely and appropriate diagnosis to guide treatment. This study aims at evaluating the utility of molecular diagnostic over conventional methods in detection of etiologic agents of central nervous system infections in Rwanda. Using a cross sectional design, 845 hospitalized patients suspected to have meningoencephalitis were enrolled from 8 study sites across the country. Four sterile tubes of Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) specimens were collected from each patient. Two tubes were analyzed on site for bacteriology, fungal, biochemistry and cytology while the other two were transported to the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for culture and Real-Time Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays. Data entry and analysis was done using Epi Info7, Excel; SPSS and STATA16. In the study, no viruses were detected using the conventional methods while a range of viruses, 152/845 (18%) were detected using real time multiplex PCR. In addition, 185/845 (22%) samples were detected as positive for different types of bacteria using the PCR compared with the 59/845 (7%) that were positive using conventional methods. There was however no difference in the detection capacity of fungal agents between the two methods with a detection level of 6%(49). This study has …

Publication: Background.
The increased number of clinical trials taking place in developing countries and the complexity of trial protocols mandate that local ethics review committees reviewing them have the capacity to ensure that they are conducted to the highest ethical standards.
Methods.
The Kenya AIDS Vaccine Initiative Institute of Clinical Research and the Kenyan National Council for Science and Technology embarked on an exercise to enhance the capacity of ERCs in Kenya to review such protocols. This process involved conducting an audit of all ERCs in the country, and performing training needs assessments to identify knowledge and capacity gaps. Information obtained was used to develop training materials for ERC members at workshops conducted in different parts of the country.
Results.
Five accredited and 13 non-accredited ERCs were identified. Four of the accredited ERCs were located in the capital city of Kenya, Nairobi. The most common challenges cited by participants during the needs assessments were excess workload, and a lack of co-ordination and/or communication between the ERCs. Subsequently, 140 ERC members from 17 institutions across the country were trained as follows: 36 from institutions in the western part of Kenya, 38 from institutions in the south-eastern coastal region, 38 from the eastern region and 44 from Nairobi.
Conclusion.
The KAVI-ICR and the NCST have developed training modules for training ERC members in Kenya and are in the process of developing a manual to train members. The Kenyan experience may be used to enhance the capacity of ERCs in the East African region.

Publication_date: Introduction A protective HIV vaccine would be expected to induce durable effector immune responses at the mucosa, restricting HIV infection at its portal of entry. We hypothesise that use of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) as an HIV delivery vector could generate sustained and robust tissue-based immunity against HIV antigens to provide long-term protection against HIV. Given that HIV uniquely targets immune-activated T cells, the development of human vaccines against HIV must also involve a specific examination of the safety of the vector. Thus, we aim to evaluate the effects of VZV vaccination on the recipients’ immune activation state, and on VZV-specific circulating humoral and cellular responses in addition to those at the cervical and rectal mucosa.
Methods and analysis This open-label, randomised, longitudinal crossover study includes healthy Kenyan VZV-seropositive women at low risk for HIV infection. Participants receive a single dose of a commercial liveattenuated VZVOka vaccine at either week 0 (n= 22) or at week 12 (n= 22) of the study and are followed for 48 and 36 weeks postvaccination, respectively. The primary outcome is the change on cervical CD4+ T-cell immune activation measured by the coexpression of CD38 and HLA-DR 12 weeks postvaccination compared with the baseline (prevaccination). Secondary analyses include postvaccination changes in VZV-specific mucosal and systemic humoral and cellular immune responses, changes in cytokine and chemokine measures, study acceptability and feasibility of mucosal sampling and a longitudinal assessment of the bacterial community composition of the mucosa. Ethics …

Patients and samples. In May 2006, a total of 50 patients on HAART and 10 ART-naıve patients were randomly selected from the HIV Comprehensive Care Centre at Coast Province General Hospital in Mombasa, Kenya. The patients were seen during regular follow-up visits, and written informed consent for participation in the study was obtained. The study was approved by the ethics review committees of the University of Nairobi and the Ghent University. The mean age of the patients was 36.9 years (standard deviation, 9.2 cells/mm3; range, 21 to 65 years), 38 (63%) of the patients were women, and 66% of the patients were in WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 (42). The mean CD4 count was 322 cells/mm3 (standard deviation, 166 cells/mm3; range, 41 to 757 cells/mm3). Patients on HAART were treated with the current regimen for a median of 12 months (ranging from 1 week to 33 months). The current regimen of two nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs)(stavudine [d4T]/zidovudine [AZT] and lamivudine [3TC]), and one nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI)(nevirapine [NVP] or efavirenz [EFV]), was the first-line regimen for 48 patients. Two patients received a second-line protease inhibitor (PI; lopinavir/ritonavir [LPV/r])-based regimen.
Ten milliliters of EDTA blood was collected, and 50 l of whole blood was immediately spotted four times on filter paper (Schleicher and Schuell 903). Filter papers were air dried overnight and stored at 20 C until processing. CD4 cell counts were performed (FACScount; Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry, Oxford, United Kingdom), and the remainder of the EDTA blood was centrifuged to collect the …

Kisumu residents aged 15-49 years were selected by two-stage cluster sampling for a baseline survey in 2008-2009, at VMMC program start-up, and repeated in 2011. Results and standard errors are weighted and reflect the probability of sampling through the complex sampling design. Analysis was performed using the R statistical system v2. 13.083 [2] and the" survey" v3. 24 package [3]. To assess if Kisumu resident women show evidence of risk compensation after exposure to Kenya’s VMMC program we examine the following:

Publication_date: Male circumcision (MC) has now been conclusively established to biologically decrease the chance of heterosexually transmitted HIV infection in males by approximately 60%[1-3]. Consequently, initiatives to introduce wide spread, safe, voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) services have commenced in several sub-Saharan African communities.

Kisumu residents aged 15-49 years were selected by two-stage cluster sampling for a baseline survey at VMMC program scale-up in 2008/2009. The survey was then repeated in 2011 using the same sample methodology and study procedures. Results and standard errors are weighted and reflect the probability of sampling through the complex sampling design. Analysis was performed using the R statistical system v2. 13.083 [3] and the" survey" v3. 24 package [4].
Communication channels were grouped into personal (private conversations with sexual partners or directly with a circumcised man), mass media (stories published/broadcast by independent media sources), mobilization messages (posters, community meetings, mobile campaigns), and targeted messages delivered in the context of health promotion (at school, health facility, or VCT center).

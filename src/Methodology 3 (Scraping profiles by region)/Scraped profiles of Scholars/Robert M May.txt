Citations: 1853
Authors:George Sugihara, Robert M May
Publication_date: 1990
Publication: An approach is presented for making short-term predictions about the trajectories of chaotic dynamical systems. The method is applied to data on measles, chickenpox, and marine phytoplankton populations, to show how apparent noise associated with deterministic chaos can be distinguished from sampling error and other sources of externally induced environmental noise.

Citations: 1566
Authors:Robert M May
Publication_date: 1988/9/16
Publication: This article surveys current answers to the factual question posed in the title and reviews the kinds of information that are needed to make these answers more precise. Various factors affecting diversity are also reviewed. These include the structure of food webs, the relative abundance of species, the number of species and of individuals in different categories of body size, along with other determinants of the commonness and rarity of organisms.

Publication: This report provides an assessment of the current state of our ecosystems and the many services they support and provide to people. Direct drivers of degradation of wetlands such as land conversion, pollution and infrastructure and indirect drivers such as population growth and economic development are discussed extensively. It enhances our on understanding the direct drivers of change to wetlands and shows how they would fare under a range of future scenarios. Responses for the wise use of wetlands including governance and institutional responses are highlighted. This report further provides an analysis of future challenges and response options that could allow us to maintain, to the greatest extent possible, the ecosystem services on which we all depend. The synthesis stresses the link between wetlands and water. Wetlands include inland wetlands such as swamps, marshes, lakes, rivers, peatlands and underground …

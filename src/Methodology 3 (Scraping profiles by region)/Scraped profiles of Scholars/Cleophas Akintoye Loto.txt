Publication: The effect of Camellia Sinensis (green tea) extract as a ‘green’inhibitor on mild steel corrosion in 0.5 M HCl and 0.8 MH2so4 was studied at ambient temperature. Weight loss/corrosion rate and potential measurement techniques were used for the experimental work. The results were further analyzed using the two-factor ANOVA. Potential measurement was performed using a digital voltmeter and a saturated calomel reference electrode. Results obtained showed effective corrosion-inhibition of the extract on the mild steel test-specimens in the different concentrations of HCl and H2SO4 used. There was increasing inhibition performance with increasing concentration of inhibitor. In 0.5 M HCl, 100% green tea gave the optimal performance with weight loss and corrosion rate of 246mg and 0.63 mm/yr respectively. A similar result was observed in 0.8 MH2so4 where 100% green tea gave the best results of 1226 mg weight loss and 3 mm/yr corrosion rate. ANOVA test confirmed the results at 95% confidence, and further showed that concentration of green tea extract had greater effect on potential and weight loss measurements. The Gibb’s free adsorption energy signified physisorption in HCl and chemisorption in H2SO4 as the adsorption mechanism of plant extract molecules on the metal surface.

Publication_date: The effect of quenching and annealing heat treatment on the localized corrosion resistance of 301 austenitic steel in 2M H2SO4/0.75%–2.25% NaCl was studied by potentiodynamic polarization, open circuit potential measurement and optical microscopy analysis. The corrosion rate of the quenched, annealed and untreated steel increased with increase in NaCl concentration. The quenched steel had the lowest corrosion rate values, followed by the annealed steel. Variation in Cl− ion concentration had no significant effect on the pitting corrosion resistance and passivation behavior of the quenched steel, though increase in current density at breakdown potential was observed at higher Cl− ion concentration. The untreated steel experienced significant reduction and collapse of it passive film after 1.5% NaCl. Delayed passivation occurred on the annealed steel following metastable pitting lead to short passivation range. Open circuit potential measurement showed large cathodic shift of the corrosion potential for the quenched steel, compared to the anodic shift for the untreated steel. Optical microscopic images showed a deteriorated morphology and the presence of different phases for the untreated 301SS. Intergranular cracks were observed on the annealed and quenched 301SS while corrosion pits was observed on the annealed 301SS.

Publication: This paper studied corrosion-inhibition and compressive-strength performances of Na2Cr2O7 (sodium dichromate) and C10H14N2Na2O8. 2H2O (ethylenediaminetetraacetic disodium salt: EDTA-Na2) admixtures in steel-reinforced concrete immersed in NaCl and in H2SO4 corrosive environments. Electrochemical methods were used for studying corrosion responses of different concentrations of the individual admixtures and their synergies, in the model that partially replace the toxic Na2Cr2O7 by the environmentally-friendly C10H14N2Na2O8. 2H2O, in steel-reinforced concretes. After the electrochemical experiment, the steel-reinforced concrete samples were subjected to the compressive-strength testing and analyses of ASTM C39/C39M-03 and ASTM C267-01. Results showed that the use of environmentally-friendly EDTA-Na2 for partially replacing toxic Na2Cr2O7 chemical exhibited better corrosioninhibition and compressive-strength improvement in the NaCl-immersed concretes, than in the H2SO4-immersed concretes. The 2g Na2Cr2O7+ 6g EDTA-Na2 admixture (representing partial replacement model of 6g Na2Cr2O7 by 6g EDTA-Na2) exhibited optimal corrosion inhibition efficiency, η= 99.0%, and very good compressive-strength improvement advantage in the NaCl-immersed concretes. In contrast, comparatively low compressivestrength reduction trade-off with the good inhibition effectiveness of η= 79.9% support use of 6g EDTA-Na2 admixture only (ie without Na2Cr2O7 addition) for inhibiting reinforcingsteel corrosion in the H2SO4-immersed concretes.

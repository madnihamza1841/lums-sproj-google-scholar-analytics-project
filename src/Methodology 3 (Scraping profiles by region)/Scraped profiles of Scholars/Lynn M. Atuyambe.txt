Authors:Lynn Muhimbuura Atuyambe
Publication_date: 2008
Publication: Introduction:
Maternal mortality remains one of the most daunting public health problems in resource limited settings. Maternal health services play a critical role in the improvement of sexual and reproductive health and rights, especially for adolescent mothers. Adolescence is a time of rapid change and transition that can be stressful and difficult; pregnancy can further complicate this period. In Uganda, morbidity and mortality among adolescent mothers and their children are high. In order to better understand this situation, studies (I-IV) were conducted with the following objectives: to describe experiences and problems of pregnant adolescents (I); to describe health seeking behaviour (II) and analyze coping responses (III) of adolescents during pregnancy, delivery and early motherhood; and to compare health seeking practices of adolescents and adult mothers during pregnancy and early motherhood (IV).
Methods:
Qualitative (I-III) and quantitative (IV) studies were carried out in Wakiso district, Uganda. In study I, six focus group discussions (FGDs) were held with adolescent mothers and pregnant adolescents, and six key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted with community leaders, persons in-charge of health units, and traditional birth attendants. In study II, 13 FGDs were conducted with married pregnant adolescents (5), unmarried pregnant adolescents (3) and married or unmarried adolescents with children (5). Semi-structured interviews were held with six KIs who were in-charge of maternity units. In study III we prospectively followed 24 pregnant adolescents (married and unmarried). Qualitative interviews about their experiences and …

Publication_date: 2008
Publication: This study was conducted to better understand adolescents' experiences and coping strategies during pregnancy and childbirth in order to meet their needs. It explored and analyzed adolescents' coping responses during these stages in Wakiso district, Uganda. A qualitative interview study was carried out between March 2005 and April 2006.Twentyfour pregnant adolescents at six months of pregnancy were consecutively recruited from four health units and interviewed at the clinics. Follow up home interviews were conducted at one week and at six months after delivery. Narratives of adolescents' ' experiences and feelings regarding their pregnancy, delivery, and early motherhood were collected. Narrative analysis was performed, condensing or reconstructing their stories into a few richer and more coherent stories. Two narrative types and one narrative case emerged from the data: 'dealing with problems' (DWP), 'avoidance and shame' (AS) and 'violence and grief' (VG). The first narrative type fits into the 'problem-focused coping' as described by Folkman and Lazarus and the two last ones into the 'emotion-focused coping.' Results suggested that those displaying problem-focused coping were mostly the married adolescents. Health workers should be trained to identify and provide care and support to parents who have lost a child, and adolescent pregnancy resource centres initiatives should be promoted.

Publication: Northern Uganda was devastated by a 20-year armed conflict from 1986 to 2006. The areas most affected were Gulu, Kitgum and Pader districts in Acholi Region, with spill over into Lira, Otuke and Aleptong districts in Lango Region. More than two million people were internally displaced. Resettlement of displaced persons, economic recovery projects and cultural and religious coping strategies have helped counteract the vulnerability of people affected by the civil war, but the pace of recovery has been slow.

79. The level and determinants of male partner involvement in routine child immunization Care in Hoima District Uganda: a cross-sectional study

Authors:Baguma Charles, Juliet Babirye, Lynn Atuyambe
Publication_date: 2014
Publication: Background: Male partner involvement in routine child immunization (RCI) services influences women’s immunization behavior and increases utilisation and timely completion of an infant’s routine immunisation schedule. Hoima district has low routine vaccination coverage and a high vaccination dropout rate. We therefore conducted this study to determine the current level of male involvement and its determinants in routine child immunisation services in Hoima district.
Methodology: This cross-sectional survey used multistage cluster sampling in 46 villages of five sub-counties in Hoima district, Uganda from which 460 men with children aged 10-23 months prior to the survey were selected. A male involvement index was constructed based on 5 indicators. A structured questionnaire elicited responses on male partner involvement in RCI as the main outcome variable. A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used for analysis in Stata version 10.0 to obtain Prevalence Risk Ratios (PRR) for association between the binary outcome and independent factors.
Results: Few men (29%) were highly involved in RCI. High male partner involvement in RCI was associated with men being older/aged 45 years and above (adj. PRR 1.91, 95% CI 1.05-3.78), having positive attitudes towards male partner involvement in RCI (adj. PRR 2.26, 95% CI 1.14-4.51), others community members ascribing to men a responsibility of taking their children for routine immunization (adj. PRR 1.75, 95% CI 1.32-2.33), and others members in the community considering male involvement in RCI as an expression of love for wife and child (adj. PRR 1.50, 95% CI 1.02-2.20), while low …

Publication: This document which is a revised version of the first edition of 2007 intends to capture the current status of health and human well-being in Africa as a whole. In doing so, shortcomings, especially in terms of policy, research, funding, data collection, human resources, training and education, and public awareness are identified, and solutions to improve health and human wellbeing in Africa are proposed.
Areas identified by the authors as being important in health and human well-being on the continent include: the burden of disease; health systems; public health; emerging and re-emerging diseases; food and nutrition security; water and sanitation; and contextual factors. Many of these factors are linked to poverty in Africa, which is a direct cause of reduced life expectancy, hunger, high infant mortality rates, and communities ravaged by disease. Many of these problems can be solved, however, if African governments spend more of their financial and intellectual resources on addressing the issues relating to the health and human well-being of their citizens. Immunisation, basic food and nutrition, and proper and adequate healthcare facilities as well as access to potable water can greatly improve living conditions on the continent.

Publication: Uganda is vulnerable to climate variability including increased frequency and intensity of rainfall, droughts and floods. Three sub-regions, Albertine in the western part of the country and Teso and Mt. Elgon in the east, suffer from recurrent floods, with resulting destruction of crops and infrastructure, water contamination and disease outbreaks. Teso sub-region also suffers from drought, and Mt. Elgon also experiences recurrent landslides. Population pressures, lack of awareness of how to mitigate these shocks and stresses, poor infrastructure (roads, schools, health facilities, water and sanitation), lack of livelihood diversification and resistance to relief or development efforts perceived as inappropriate or favoring certain beneficiaries have prevented communities in these vulnerable areas from improving their incomes. Land shortage has led communities to reclaim wetlands and forest reserves, dramatically changing the ecosystem.

Publication: Introduction and background: Globally, at least a third of all pregnancies are unplanned, resulting in high rates of unsafe abortions especially in developing countries. In Uganda, a country with a high total fertility rate (TFR= 6.2), about three quarters (755,000) of women get unintended pregnancies annually (UDHS 2011). The high number of unwanted pregnancies and TFR suggest a low uptake of family planning (FP). Although Contraceptive Prevalence Rates (CPRs) for modern FP methods has increased in the past 5 years from 18% to 24%(UDHS 2011), the use of male controlled methods (male condoms) or the support of their partner’s use of FP methods are still limited. Previous studies have showed that enhancing partner/spousal communication about FP can increase male involvement in FP, which in turn can improve CPR and reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies. Over the years, a number of civil …

110. Factors influencing acceptance and utilization of ITNs and IRS as malaria vector control measures in Rakai District, Uganda.

Publication_date: 2008
Publication: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide treated nets (ITNs) are the two recommended strategies promoted for scaling up malaria control in Rakai district. The question has been, How acceptable are these methods and how often do households members use bed nets after procurement for effective malaria control? OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the acceptability and level of utilization of IRS and ITNs among households in Rakai district in Uganda. DESIGN: A Cross sectional study involving 303 households selected by stratified random sampling RESULTS: Prevalence of bed nets (40%) at household level in Rakai district was much lower than the national or Rakai District target of 50%. Household ownership of ITNs (14%) was less than half of the total households with bed nets. Consistency in bed net use which was at 67% is influenced by believing that bed nets are effective in preventing malaria (OR=2.68 C1=1.22-5-91), and that nets should be used when mosquitoes are many (OR=0.01 C1=0.00-0.05). Bed net use does not depend on whether a bed net is donated or not (OR= 0.44 C1=0.19-1.02). There was high acceptance of ITNs (93%) and IRS (90%) in Rakai District. However, only 49% of the household that knew about DDT would accept it as a chemical for IRS. Determinants of DDT acceptance as a chemical; for IRS are; believing that DDT is harmful to health, (OR=0.01 C1=0.01 C1=0.00-0.02), inadequate information about DDT (OR= 0.00 C1=0.00-0.01), occurrence of a malaria episode in the household (OR=4.89 C1=1.96-10.27), Knowing other IRS chemicals (0R=4.90 C1=2.10-11.43), and accepting to use ITNs (OR=10.25 …

This paper provides indications on likelihood that potential early adopters of circumcision were more in need of the measure.
Methods: Data were from 2011 Uganda AIDS Indictor Survey. Prevalence risk ratios were obtained as measures of association between willingness to circumcise and sexual risk behaviours.
Results: 44% of the 5,776 men expressed willingness to circumcise. In unadjusted analyses, all sexual risk behaviours were associated with willingness while in adjusted, non-marital sex (Adj PRR 1.27; CI: 1.16-1.40) and non-use of condoms at last such sex (Adj PRR 1.18; CI: 1.07-1.29) were associated with higher willingness to circumcise. Conclusion: Willingness was high, more common among men reporting sexual risk behaviours. Early adopters of SMC were likely to be in need of such HIV protective measures.

Publication_date: Background
Unintended pregnancies account for more than half of the 2.2 million pregnancies that occur in Uganda (Hussain, 2013). Although adolescent pregnancy in Uganda has decreased over the last decade, 24% of women aged 15-19 still report being currently pregnant or having already had a child (Uganda Bureau of Statistics & ICF International, Inc., 2012). In 2011, 41.7% of births among adolescent girls 15-19 years of age were reported as mistimed or unwanted. Adolescents with unintended pregnancies may be particularly motivated to pursue an abortion because of the potential consequences for their lives or because of the circumstances around the pregnancy (Kaye et al., 2005; Olukoya et al., 2001).
Abortion is legally restricted in most cases in Uganda, increasing the likelihood that adolescents will pursue unsafe abortions that pose a danger to their health. Fear of imprisonment, as well as the strong societal stigma around abortion, drives the practice underground (Mbonye, 2000; Paluku et al., 2013; Prada et al., 2005). Concerns about cost and privacy, and the perception that services are inappropriate for them, also serve as a deterrent to adolescents seeking out more formalized care (Atuyambe et al., 2005; Woog et al., 2015). In spite of these obstacles, there is evidence that suggests abortion happens quite commonly (Hussain, 2013; Singh et al., 2006; Singh & Maddow-Zimet, 2015), and abortion-related complications, including hemorrhage, sepsis, and damage to the uterus, have been found to account for nearly 40% of emergency obstetric care cases, and also impose considerable costs on the health care system (Mbonye …

Publication_date: Background: Maternal health services have a potentially critical role in the improvement of reproductive health. In order to get a better understanding of adolescent mothers’ service needs we compared health seeking practices of first time adolescent and adult mothers during pregnancy and early motherhood in Wakiso district, Uganda.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted between May and August, 2007 in Wakiso district. A total of 762 women (442 adolescents and 320 adult) were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. We assessed odds ratios with their 95% CI for health care seeking at antenatal and postnatal, stigma and experience of violence from parents comparing adolescents to adult first time mothers. STATA V. 8 was used for data analysis.
Results: Adolescent mothers were significantly more disadvantaged in terms of health care seeking for reproductive health services and faced …

Publication_date: Millions of children continue to miss immunizations each year despite global increases in financing and advances in vaccine technology. Male involvement in routine child immunization activities could improve and sustain coverage but is rarely emphasized in immunization programs or research. This study identified factors associated with male involvement in routine child immunization using the attitude, social influence and selfefficacy model. A household cluster survey was conducted among 460 fathers aged 18 years or more, with children aged 10-23 months. A semi-structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Prevalence Risk Ratios (PRRs) were used to measure associations with level of involvement using generalized linear models with Poisson family, log link and robust standard errors in STATA 12. Our findings show that half (51%, 236/460) of the respondents were aged 25-34 years; 36%(166/460) had completed eight or more years of formal education. Although 90%(415/460) of the respondents were willing to be involved, only 29%(133/460) were highly involved in routine child immunization. Highly involved fathers had a positive attitude towards involvement in routine child immunization (adj. PRR 2.3, 95% CI 1.18–4.98) and were≥ 45 years [adjusted prevalence risk ratio (adj. PRR) 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-3.76]. Traders had a lower involvement compared to those engaged in other occupations (adj. PRR 0.55, 95% CI: 0.37-0.82). In conclusion, few fathers were involved in routine child immunization. Strategies to improve fathers’ positive attitude such as health education are needed to …

Publication_date: Safe Male Circumcision is a known intervention in prevention of heterosexual HIV acquisition. However, since the roll-out of the male circumcision policy in Uganda, concerns that circumcision may lead to behaviour disinhibition are rife. We assess association between male circumcision and risky sexual behaviour among Ugandan men. Data are from AIDS Indicator Survey 2011 with 7,969 ever sexually active men 15-59 years. Association between risky sexual behaviour and circumcision were determined using odds ratios. Adjusted logistic regression models controlled for individual characteristics. The prevalence of circumcision was 28% and most common risky sexual behaviours were; multiple life-time sexual partners, non marital sex and non-use of condoms during such sex. In the adjusted analyses, multiple life-time partners, adj. OR= 1.47 (95% CI 1.28-1.68), engagement in non marital sex, adj. OR= 1.25 (95% CI: 1.03-1.50), and non-use of condom at such sex were significantly higher among the circumcised. HIV prevalence was lower among the circumcised even with risky sexual behaviours.

Publication: METHODS
The survey used stratified random sampling to select 45 primary schools and 45 high schools proportionally from the three NSW education sectors (independent, Catholic and Department of School Education). Schools from the most remote regions in the north-west of the State were excluded because of prohibitive travel costs.
In primary schools one class was selected at random from each of Years 2, 4 and 6; in high schools, one class was selected at random from each of Years 8 and 10. Fourteen physical education teachers, representing all three education systems, were seconded for the project. These teachers were involved in the field work and were supported by several research officers with public health and education backgrounds.

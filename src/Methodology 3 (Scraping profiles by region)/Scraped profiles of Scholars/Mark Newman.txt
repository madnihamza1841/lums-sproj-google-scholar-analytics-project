Publication: Figure 1:(a) Power-law and exponential distributions, for several choices of parameters. In both cases, x≥ xmin= 1.(b) The ratio of power-law and exponential distributions, illustrating that events that are effectively “impossible”(negligible probability under an exponential distribution) become practically commonplace under a power-law distribution.
1Mathematically, the only way to have something that behaves like a power-law distribution but with a heavier tail than α≳ 1 is to effectively truncate its upper range, eg, by adding an exponential cutoff in the upper tail like this: Pr (x)∝ x− αe− λx.

Publication_date: 2010/10/5
Publication: The response of an ecosystem to perturbations is mediated by both antagonistic and facilitative interactions between species. It is thought that a community's resilience depends crucially on the food web—the network of trophic interactions—and on the food web's degree of compartmentalization. Despite its ecological importance, compartmentalization and the mechanisms that give rise to it remain poorly understood. Here we investigate several definitions of compartments, propose ways to understand the ecological meaning of these definitions, and quantify the degree of compartmentalization of empirical food webs. We find that the compartmentalization observed in empirical food webs can be accounted for solely by the niche organization of species and their diets. By uncovering connections between compartmentalization and species' diet contiguity, our findings help us understand which perturbations can result in fragmentation of the food web and which can lead to catastrophic effects. Additionally, we show that the composition of compartments can be used to address the long-standing question of what determines the ecological niche of a species.

Publication_date: 2007/6/5
Publication: Networks are widely used in the biological, physical, and social sciences as a concise mathematical representation of the topology of systems of interacting components. Understanding the structure of these networks is one of the outstanding challenges in the study of complex systems. Here we describe a general technique for detecting structural features in large-scale network data that works by dividing the nodes of a network into classes such that the members of each class have similar patterns of connection to other nodes. Using the machinery of probabilistic mixture models and the expectation-maximization algorithm, we show that it is possible to detect, without prior knowledge of what we are looking for, a very broad range of types of structure in networks. We give a number of examples demonstrating how the method can be used to shed light on the properties of real-world networks, including social and information networks.

Authors:Mark Newman
Publication_date: 2000
Publication: “The total amount of data provided by ocean research is equivalent to that collected daily by meteorologists.” That paraphrased comment, made some years ago, is fast getting out of date. As was evident at a conference* held last month, the upshot of merged research agendas from biology, chemistry and physical oceanography over the past decade is that the balance is being redressed. This is especially so where oceanic carbon is concerned—the central issue for research is of course how the oceans will respond to, and maybe accommodate, the human passion for CO2 emission and the climate change it is likely to cause. The greatest uncertainties seem to lie more with the biology than with the physics and chemistry of ocean processes. Maybe this is not surprising. Global-scale oceanography has its roots largely in the physical sciences, so we have a better picture of how physical and chemical parameters—pH, temperature, circulation and so on—can regulate carbon exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere. But it is marine organisms that can really tap into physicochemical carbon cycling and lock up carbon on geological timescales. Equally, it is the biological response to climate change that seems to be the most difficult to predict. For example, the formation of calcium carbonate shells by certain algae—a process that counterintuitively releases CO2—appears to be reduced under conditions of higher levels of atmospheric CO2 (I. Zondervan, Alfred Wegener Inst., Bremerhaven). So if the balance between carbonate chemistry and photosynthesis shifts in the future, these organisms might switch from being a carbon source to …

Publication_date: Functional explanations advocated for mixed-species groups (mainly foraging and anti-predator advantages) are based on top-down approaches that implicitly assume the species as fixed and static social structures and shift the analysis of fitness benefits and costs from the level of individuals to the one of the groups/species. According to Farine, this operation of over-simplification leads to cursory inferences. On the contrary, a bottom-up approach, usually used to study intraspecific sociality, could provide an insight and a better understanding of the emergent and dynamic properties at each level of the social system. In this perspective, the author proposes Social Network Analysis (SNA) as a tool to measure inter-individual interaction within mixed species flocks. His aim is to explore the different roles within the flocks and the individual variations of sociality, as well as the fitness consequences that such variations leads to both individual and community structure. SNA main strength is the possibility to graphically represent and quantify, at any scale between dyads and groups, specific aspects of social relationships, such as number, intensity, frequency of direct and indirect interactions and individual roles, centrality (ie “keystone” individuals). As an istance, Loussou & Newman (2004) found a “keystone” individual in a bottlenose dolphin community in Scotland that acted as a bridge between two subgroups, therefore playing a critical role in keeping the connection between them. However, SNA current applications raise some issues concerning spatial and temporal constraints (Wey et al. 2008). On one hand, pattern of associations vary on a case …

Publication_date: We introduce a new model of evolution on a tness landscape possessing a tunable degree of neutrality. The model allows us to study the general properties of molecular species undergoing neutral evolution. We nd that a number of phenomena seen in RNA sequence-structure maps are present also in our general model. Examples are the occurrence of\common" structures which occupy a fraction of the genotype space which tends to unity as the length of the genotype increases, and the formation of percolating neutral networks which cover the genotype space in such a way that a member of such a network can be found within a small radius of any point in the space. We also describe a number of new phenomena which appear to be general properties of neutrally evolving systems. In particular, we show that the maximum tness attained during the adaptive walk of a population evolving on such a tness landscape increases with increasing degree of neutrality, and is directly related to the tness of the most t percolating network.

Publication_date: Functional explanations advocated for mixed-species groups (mainly foraging and anti-predator advantages) are based on top-down approaches that implicitly assume the species as fixed and static social structures and shift the analysis of fitness benefits and costs from the level of individuals to the one of the groups/species. According to Farine, this operation of over-simplification leads to cursory inferences. On the contrary, a bottom-up approach, usually used to study intraspecific sociality, could provide an insight and a better understanding of the emergent and dynamic properties at each level of the social system. In this perspective, the author proposes Social Network Analysis (SNA) as a tool to measure inter-individual interaction within mixed species flocks. His aim is to explore the different roles within the flocks and the individual variations of sociality, as well as the fitness consequences that such variations leads to both individual and community structure. SNA main strength is the possibility to graphically represent and quantify, at any scale between dyads and groups, specific aspects of social relationships, such as number, intensity, frequency of direct and indirect interactions and individual roles, centrality (ie “keystone” individuals). As an istance, Loussou & Newman (2004) found a “keystone” individual in a bottlenose dolphin community in Scotland that acted as a bridge between two subgroups, therefore playing a critical role in keeping the connection between them. However, SNA current applications raise some issues concerning spatial and temporal constraints (Wey et al. 2008). On one hand, pattern of associations vary on a case …

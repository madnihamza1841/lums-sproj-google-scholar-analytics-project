Publication_date: 2010
Publication: Think global act locally, it is a phrase used to promote the concept of sustainable community. A sustainable community is often defined as a community which uses its resources to meet current needs without compromising the ability of resource usages of future generations to meet their own needs. However, pragmatic evidence has showed that it has been very difficult to put the principles of sustainable development on practice. The purpose of this is research was to identify the sustainability practices that limit sustainability in the transport segment within a neighborhood in the northwestern Mexico. This research consists of an exploratory study in order to gain a greater understanding of how the members in this community are contributing to sustainable development by living under their own behaviors and lifestyles. The study focus on the following segments: transport, environment, housing, social, and economic. In this paper is presented only the transport segment findings which revealed current transport practices in this community are compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs; therefore, the neighborhood is not sustainable. On the other hand, findings also reveal that there is a real commitment to become a sustainable community in the future in order to maintain their wellness for long time

Authors:Nora E Munguia, Tania G Poom, Luis E Velazquez, Javier Esquer
Publication_date: Currently, industries are required to include best practices in order to reduce the impact of their activities with their environment. The nature of the production process of industry will be the determining factor in efforts to prevent pollution. So making a precise characterization of the process is an essential part for cleaner production. This work, with this recognition, aims to propose a program of cleaner production and pollution prevention in a re manufacturing industry of automotive plastic parts in the city of Hermosillo, Sonora, this program is based on the eight steps of a Industrial Pollution Prevention Handbook, taking place within the period of May to December 2012. During the development of this research was detected the existence of environmental and occupational risks. Quantitative and qualitative analysis was made for the assessment of these, in order to broaden the scope of understanding. Increase the scope of the project is recommended in order to take advantage of the corporate interest in improving their practices due to the importance of achieving a greater competitiveness on terms of sustainability.

50. Sustainable Water Management in the University of Sonora, Mexico
Citations: 
Authors:N Munguíaa, M Ojedab, L Velázquez
Publication_date: Although water is an abundant resource in the planet, its quality has declined dramatically all over the world. Water pollution has affected oceans, rivers, lakes, and ponds, but mainly drinking water sources. Water scarcity is not only exacerbated by pollution but also by droughts. As a consequence, many countries around the world are experiencing water shortages and/or water crisis. Mexico is not the exception to this; neither does the state of Sonora which has been one of the most affected since its residents have suffered 12 years of drought and the effects of a growing urbanization. Therefore, water management has become a major challenge to sustain the economic growth in the region.
The majority of water pollutants are originated from human activities; consequently, it is possible to avoid them by implementing cleaner production and pollution prevention principles. With the purpose to take responsibility for conserving this resource, the University of Sonora, has implemented a Sustainability Management System (SMS) on campus which was third-party certified in July 2008. Thank to this, the University of Sonora has become the first public higher education institution to get the ISO14001: 2004 certification not only in Mexico but also in Latin America. This higher education institution is the biggest, most important and most prestigious university in both the capital city of Hermosillo and the state of Sonora, at the northwestern region of Mexico. It is a public university with 31,830 students in five campuses in the state.

51. Energy Efficiency in Maquiladoras of Electronic Components: A Cleaner Production Approach
Citations: 
Authors:L VELAZQUEZ, J ESQUER, R GARCIA, N VARGAS, R VELDERRAIN
Publication_date: Estimates by the International Energy Agency show that the world’s demand for energy will increase 1.6% annually until 2030; this is mostly due to the rapid growth in the economies of developing countries. Currently, almost two thirds of the world’s energy resources are used in production lines; therefore, not only is energy management an operational and administrative priority for entrepreneurs, but has also become a matter of public and governmental concern.
Given the fact that the manufacturing industry is a powerful energy consumer, energy efficiency has become a key element to maintaining competitiveness and core advantages, since not only it does contribute to cut costs and reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses (GHG), but it also aids maquiladoras in their efforts to build an image of prestige and repute in the eyes of the competitors, the employees and other stakeholders. It also helps them developing strong policies to grow as a socially responsible company and paves the way to true sustainable development.

Authors:Luis Velázquez, Andrea Zavala Munguía
Publication_date: This paper is aimed at discussing the role of the ISO 14001 standard in the transformation of a Mexican higher education institution in a sustainable university. In July 2008, the University of Sonora has become the first public higher education institution to get the ISO14001: 2004 certification not only in Mexico but also in Latin America. The content in this paper is not a full explanation about the experience of implementing ISO 14001 on campus; rather it is a discussion of four shortcomings encountered in the implementation of this standard on campus.
Environmental management systems (EMS) seem to be a reasonable, systematic, and efficient approach to move towards sustainability, but in the world only few universities have tried to implement Environmental Management Systems as a tool to compliance with some regulations as well as a mean to improve its environmental performance.

Publication_date: The concepts of Sustainable Development (SD) and Management Systems (MS) are finding increasing acceptance in a variety of fields, including academy, politics, and nongovernmental organizations. These concepts are also being used by the general population. This paper describes the perception of different experts by discussing about the usefulness of Sustainability Management Systems (SMS) as holistic systems that might integrate environmental, social, and economic elements. Fourteen interviews have been conducted with several experts around the world. Some of them are professionals in Sustainability issues in general, and some of them in environmental, health and safety (EHS) issues in particular. The results have shown that, although there is a continuous debate on the sustainability approach, several core elements can be addressed through Sustainability Management Systems (SMS).

Publication: As an entrant in the 2008 Semantic Robot Vision Challenge (SRVC), UBC’s Curious George robot will demonstrate that the combination of numerous state-of-the-art techniques from the current vision literature can produce a relatively robust visual search robot, with many of the competencies required, for example, for elder care. The SRVC task is to locate a set of unknown objects in an unknown environment, using only the World Wide Web as a source for specific training imagery. In 2007, Curious George placed first in the SRVC robot league, succeeding to fully or partially recognize 7 objects. The UBC team is committed to improving performance substantially for the 2008 contest, primarily by leveraging additional training information available on the Web, more sophisticated classifiers and by better exploiting the embodied vision system to gather cues for scene understanding. For example, semantic hierarchies of objects are available in various forms on the web. These can be used to filter inappropriate images and broaden visual representations by querying for images of closely related objects. Finally, active visual search can integrate recognition over frames as well as using appearance, structure and motion cues for mid-level vision tasks such as segmentation. The remainder of this abstract decomposes the SRVC into sub-tasks and describes our approach to each.

Authors:DG Lowe
Publication_date: 1984
Publication: A computational model is presented for the visual recognition of three-dimensional objects based upon their spatial correspondence with two-dimensional features in an image. A number of components of this model are developed in further detail and implemented as computer algorithms. At the highest level, a verification process was developed which can determine exact values of viewpoint and object parameters from hypothesized matches between three-dimensional object features and two-dimensional image features. This provides a reliable quantitative procedure for evaluating the correctness of an interpretation, even in the presence of noise or occlusion. Given a reliable method for final evaluation of correspondence, the remaining components of the system are aimed at reducing the size of the search space which must be covered. Unlike many previous approaches, this recognition process does not …

Publication: This review paper summarized the preparation of ternary chalcogenide thin films using electrodeposition method. Electro deposition method is emerged as one of the most preferred deposition technique to produce large area thin films by many researchers. Many efforts are currently directly to generation of binary, ternary and quaternary thin films based on metal sulfide, selenide and telluride using this method.

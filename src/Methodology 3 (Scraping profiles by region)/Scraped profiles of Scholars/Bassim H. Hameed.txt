Publication_date: 2003
Publication: lAboratory batch studies were conducted on adsorption of phenol, 3-chlorophenol and o-cresol from aqueous solution by Norit Granular Activated Carbon (NAC 1240). The effect of various initial concentrations and time of adsorption on phenols adsorption process were investigated. The time required for adsorbates to reach equilibrium condition was about 2S h for range of initial phenols concentration between 25-200 mg/I. A maximum percentage of removal of 90% phenol and 99% of 3-chlorophenol and o-cresol were obtained under adsorption operating conditions of 30 C, 120 rpm, 25 h adsorption time and initial solute concentrations of 25 and 50 mg/1. It was observed that an increase in initial solute concentration results in increase of phenols uptake from liquid to solid phase. The suitability of Langmuir and Freundlich model were evaluated to estimate the monolayer capacity values of the activated carbon used for each sorbate-sorbent system. The adsorption behaviour of phenolic compounds on NAC 1240 was best described by Langmuir isothenn model in the whole range of initial concentrations studied. The order of adsorption capacity among the phenolic compounds was o-cresol> 3-chlorophenol> phenol. The values of adsorption capacity of 270.3, 166.7 and 161.3 mg/g were obtained for o-cresol, 3-chlorophenol and phenol, respectively.
